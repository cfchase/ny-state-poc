$^{FY 2024 }$

## **Higher Education**

Higher education capital spending includes the costs of the SUNY and CUNY capital plans as well as funding for private colleges and universities through the HECap Program.

The Capital Plan provides SUNY and CUNY with $7.2 billion in new appropriations over the fiveyear period. New capital funding will allow the university systems to maintain existing capital infrastructure, as well as advance new capital investments.

The five-year plan includes $4.5 billion to support infrastructure improvements at SUNY Stateoperated campuses and CUNY senior colleges ($2.9 billion for SUNY and $1.6 billion for CUNY) and $574 million to match local sponsor funding for community college capital projects. Other expenses in the five-year plan include: $1.1 billion for SUNY maintenance and operations positions; $375 million for SUNY residence hall projects funded with dorm fees; $378 million for CUCF, DASNY, and SUCF operations; $150 million for capital projects at SUNY hospitals funded with hospital revenue; $100 million for SUNY campus-funded projects; and $40 million for HECap grants to private colleges.

For FY 2025, the Enacted Budget provides $1.5 billion in new bonded spending authority, which includes: $710 million for SUNY State-operated campuses, $424 million for CUNY senior colleges, $154 million ($138 million for SUNY and $16 million for CUNY) to support capital projects at community colleges, $150 million for SUNY hospitals, and $40 million for HECap grants.

The Capital Plan assumes $1.9 billion in FY 2025 disbursements for higher education capital expenses. Of this amount, SUNY is projected to spend $1.4 billion, which includes: $910 million for the State-operated campuses and hospitals; $86 million for community colleges; $75 million for educational facility projects supported by non-State funds (i.e., grants and donations); $100 million for dormitory-related projects; $29 million for the SUCF; and $210 million for staff whose job duties include the maintenance, preservation, and operation of facilities. CUNY is projected to spend $506 million in FY 2025 for capital projects, including $465 million for senior colleges and community colleges, as well as $41 million for operating costs supported by the General Fund. Additionally, the HECap Program is expected to disburse $34 million during FY 2025 in support of private college and university projects.

Overall spending for higher education capital projects is projected to increase by $452 million from FY 2024 to FY 2025.
