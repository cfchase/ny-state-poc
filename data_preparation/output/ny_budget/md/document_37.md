State-related debt outstanding is projected to increase from $54.3 billion in FY 2024 to $62.5 billion in FY 2025. Debt issuances during FY 2025 are expected to add about $5.2 billion in new debt, while $594 million of State-related debt is expected to be retired during FY 2025. In addition, the State is expected to finalize a service contract (i.e., financing agreement) with GDC to cover the costs related to the Hudson Tunnel Project, which adds $1.3 billion of new debt obligations in FY 2025. Projected State-related debt outstanding at the end of FY 2025 is summarized by major programmatic area and credit below.

## **FY 2025 Debt Service**

State-related debt service is projected to total $3.0 billion in FY 2025. The State's debt service costs consist of payments to meet obligations for bonds issued over the past 30 years, as well as new debt service costs that will result from bond issuances projected to occur during the forecast period. Debt service payments due on existing debt total approximately $2.9 billion. The remaining FY 2025 payments are for new money debt issued in FY 2025 ($129 million). State-related debt service costs also include service contract payments to GDC related to the Hudson Tunnel Project ($3 million). These debt service payments reflect the amount that is expected to be paid in FY 2025 and are not adjusted for prepayments.

Bond-financed capital investments, primarily for transportation, education, and economic development account for most of the State's debt service costs. The majority of debt service costs are for bonds approved by the Legislature, on behalf of the people, and issued on the State's behalf by public authorities. As the State issues bonds under the PIT and Sales Tax credit structures, debt service for service contract bonds will decline, while PIT and Sales Tax Revenue Bond debt service will increase.

The following charts summarize debt service costs by both program area and financing program.
