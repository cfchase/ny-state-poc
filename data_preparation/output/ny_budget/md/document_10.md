The Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project consists of three elements: (i) a new two-track tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey; (ii) the Hudson Yards Concrete Casing; and (iii) the rehabilitation of the existing Amtrak North River Tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey. Funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project was originally expected to be split equally between the Federal government (50 percent) and the local sponsors (50 percent), consistent with a 2015 framework agreement among the Federal government, the PANYNJ, New York State and the State of New Jersey. However, additional Federal funding subsequently reduced the local sponsors' share. The January 2024 financial plan for the Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project reflected an estimated total project cost of $16.0 billion, with the local funding commitment for construction costs totaling $4.3 billion, or 27 percent, allocated among the State of New Jersey, the State of New York and the PANYNJ. New York State's capital commitment for the Hudson Tunnel Project is expected to be funded with a USDOT RRIF loan obtained by the GDC, a bi-state public authority. The State expects to make annual payments to the GDC equal to the principal and interest on the RRIF loan as the same shall become due. Such payments are subject to annual appropriation by the State Legislature. The State has no plans to issue State-supported debt to fund its annual payment obligation to GDC. The maximum annual payments on the RRIF loan are not expected to exceed $83 million when fully annualized. Such payments are expected to be substantially lower during the

construction period, with the initial payments beginning in FY 2025, consistent with the terms of the RRIF loan. The following table shows the costs to repay the RRIF annual loan payments as estimated in the January 2024 financial plan. Initial debt service costs relate to ongoing annual fees associated with the RRIF loan. Principal and interest payments on the loan are projected to commence in FY 2034 after substantial completion of the project.
