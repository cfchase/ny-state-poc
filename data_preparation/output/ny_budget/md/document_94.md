## **AGENCY SUMMARY AND DETAIL TABLES**

## **AGENCY SUMMARY AND DETAIL TABLES**

The following tables provide a summary of projected appropriations, commitments, and disbursements for each agency on both a comprehensive construction program and capital projects fund basis. Immediately following the agency summary table are detailed projected disbursements for each fiscal year, beginning in FY 2025, by individual appropriation on a comprehensive construction program basis. The disbursements on these tables reflect projected spending from reappropriations and new appropriations effective for State FY 2025 and beyond, as well as appropriations anticipated to be recommended in future State fiscal years from FY 2025 through FY 2028. Spending that is not made from a capital appropriation is not reported on in the agency and summary detail tables. All amounts are in thousands of dollars.

Reappropriations and appropriations in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget represent the estimated costs for the various agencies and the respective comprehensive construction programs. Each of the reappropriations, new appropriations, and future appropriations are identified by a reference number, as required by section 22-c of the State Finance Law. These individual eight-character reference numbers are included at the end of the text for each Enacted appropriation, and the fifth and sixth characters identify the State fiscal year in which it was originally Enacted. Reference numbers for new appropriations for FY 2025 will display 24 as the fifth and sixth characters.
