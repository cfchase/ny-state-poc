## **Education**

Education capital spending includes the costs of the Smart Schools General Obligation Bond Act, funding for the SED capital plan, and the EXCEL program.

Current estimates in the Capital Plan project that the State will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the upcoming five-year period for SED's capital projects. This projection includes: $898 million for the Smart Schools Bond Act; $309 million for nonpublic school health and safety projects, including maintenance of nonpublic schools' facilities; $122 million for public library construction projects; $78 million for health and safety projects at the State-supported schools for the blind and deaf; $68 million for renovation projects at State-owned schools on Native American reservations; $59 million for the Cultural Education Storage Facility; $38 million for infrastructure improvements and minor rehabilitation projects at the Rome School for the Deaf, Batavia School for the Blind, the Cultural Education Center, and the Education Building; $35 million for the development of a State aid data system; $26 million for safety and security upgrades at nonpublic schools, day cares, community centers, and residential and day camps; $24 million for the ongoing development of an electronic licensing system for the Office of the Professions; $21 million for other projects, including the New York State Museum Gallery Renewal and the State Longitudinal Data System; $21 million to support personal service and other costs associated with staff whose duties include the maintenance, preservation, and operation of SED facilities; $17 million for Smart Schools nonpublic school projects; $13 million for EXCEL; and $10 million for renovation projects at the New York State Museum, Library, and Archives.

The FY 2025 Capital Plan expands SED's capital budget by providing $189 million in new capital appropriations to support: nonpublic school health and safety projects, including repair and maintenance of nonpublic schools' facilities ($70 million); construction projects at public libraries ($44 million); health and safety projects at the State-supported schools for the blind and deaf ($30 million); rehabilitation and renovation projects at State-owned schools on Native American reservations ($20 million); renovation projects at the New York State Museum, Library, and Archives ($10 million); rehabilitation and renovation projects at the School for the Blind and the School for the Deaf ($7 million); maintenance projects at SED's other State-owned facilities ($3 million); and personal service and other costs associated with staff whose duties include the maintenance, preservation, and operation of SED facilities ($4 million).

Overall spending for education capital projects is projected to increase by $248 million in FY 2025. The increase is largely due to continued spending from the Smart Schools Bond Act, the implementation of additional programs included in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget, and implementation delays in prior year initiatives.
