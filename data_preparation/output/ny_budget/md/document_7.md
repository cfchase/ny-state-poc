o Sized capital investments to fit within the State's statutory debt limit over the 5-year period by prioritizing capital investments to maintain an affordable Capital Plan.

o Added $10 billion of cash resources, including an increase of $1 billion in the Enacted Budget, for PAYGO capital spending to improve debt affordability. This funding is being used to avoid the issuance of debt, by allowing the State to use cash to supplant borrowing for both higher-cost taxable debt and assets with short economic useful lives. The reduction in debt issuances provides both debt service savings and debt cap relief.

o Transitioned personnel costs at DASNY and OGS, which total $40 million annually and relate to managing State construction projects for OMH, OPWDD and OASAS, from bond-financing to PAYGO (cash) beginning in FY 2025.

o Initiated $20.5 billion of debt prepayments in FYs 2021 - 2024 to enable the State to retire debt early.

o Generated $427 million of present value savings in FY 2024 by refinancing debt, which takes advantage of lower interest rates.

o Reduced the BIC, a fee assessed on most State public authority bond issues, from $8.40 per bond to $3.50 per bond and eliminated BIC on refundings. This will lower the cost of issuing debt and generate long-term debt service savings for the State.

ï‚· Reflects the positive impact of managing the State's debt burden responsibly for decades.

o New York's credit rating of AA+ is at its highest level since 1972. The State has two highly-rated revenue credits and GO Bonds that are in high demand by investors.

o At 3.5 percent, New York's debt "burden" as measured as a share of State personal income is at its lowest level in 60 years. This is true even though the State intervened to assist the MTA during the pandemic and issued $6.1 billion in debt on its behalf.

o The State ended FY 2024 with debt outstanding of $54.3 billion which is virtually unchanged from debt outstanding 10-years prior. Adjusted for inflation, the State's debt level today is roughly the same as it was in 1982.
