Five-Year Capital Spending by Financing Source (millions of dollars)

## **Transportation and Transit**

The Capital Plan further expands the State's investments in transportation and mass transit infrastructure. The FY 2025 Enacted Budget includes funding support for both the DOT and the MTA Capital Plans. Both are increases over previous plans and will continue to improve the State's transportation and transit systems.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget reflects the third year of a $33 billion, five-year DOT Capital Plan that will improve the State's roads, bridges, airports, rail facilities, ports, and other transit systems. The DOT Capital Plan provides almost $7.7 billion in FY 2025 and includes funding from both State and Federal resources.

For FY 2025, the Capital Plan includes $638 million for the CHIPS and Marchiselli local highway and bridge programs; $100 million for Extreme Winter Recovery; $140 million for State Touring Routes; $45 million for freight and passenger rail; and $27 million for aviation. The Capital Plan also commits $150 million in local highway aid through the PAVE NY program and includes an additional $200 million to fund Pave Our Potholes, a State and local program that commits $1 billion over the five-year plan. The Capital Plan also includes $200 million to fund local bridge projects from the BRIDGE NY program as part of a $1 billion total commitment over the five-year plan.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget also includes $18 million to fund the bus terminal expansion to the Louise M. Slaughter Intermodal Station in Rochester.
