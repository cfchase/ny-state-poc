## **CAPITAL PROGRAM AND FINANCING PLAN**

## **FY 2025 Capital Projects Spending**

## **$^{ }$State Capital Spending**

State capital spending is authorized from appropriations made in the State budget and funded with State Authority Bonds, General Obligation Bonds, PAYGO resources, and/or Federal grants. The State Capital Plan balances the need to preserve the State's assets, invest in new initiatives, and maintain a plan that is affordable. The Capital Plan limits debt issuances to a level that is expected to allow the State to remain in compliance with its statutorily imposed debt limits and maintains sufficient capital spending for core capital projects. The Capital Plan continues investments in transportation and transit infrastructure, affordable and homeless housing, economic development, environmental protection and infrastructure, and health care.

Spending on capital projects is projected to total $17.7 billion in FY 2025. Overall, capital spending in FY 2025 is projected to increase by $2.9 billion or 20 percent from FY 2024.
