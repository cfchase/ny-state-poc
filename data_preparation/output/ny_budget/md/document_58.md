## **All Other**

Spending for agencies in the All Other category supports capital investments for the SIA; SAM, CREST, and LOCAP grant programs; statewide equipment, systems development and upgrades; the Arts and Cultural Facilities program; Lake Ontario REDI program; and capital projects for the Judiciary, the Department of Law (Attorney General), and OSC. Additionally, All Other spending includes a spending adjustment to accommodate potential under-spending projected to occur as a result of normal timing related to the delivery of capital projects as well as the implementation of capital efficiency plans at State agencies and authorities.

## **State and Municipal Facilities**

The Capital Plan retains $1.9 billion in reappropriations for the State and Municipal Facilities Program. Entities eligible to receive grants under this program include: State agencies, local governments (e.g., counties, cities, towns, and villages), MTA, SUNY and CUNY senior and community colleges, private nonprofit colleges and universities, public school districts, public housing authorities, public libraries, fire districts, and other entities.

Similar to other State funded grant programs, non-State entities receiving funds through the State and Municipal Facilities Program must be qualified for eligibility through the NYS Grants Gateway, which includes a vetting process to determine organizational integrity, capacity to administer grants, and legal compliance. Additionally, the program administrator (DASNY) performs an independent review and certification process to assess a potential grantee's: (i) grant history, (ii) institutional and employee integrity, (iii) compliance with all NYS laws and regulations, and (iv) fiscal responsibility and resources.
