The DOB 1 publishes the Capital Program and Financing Plan twice a year, with the Executive Budget and the Enacted Budget. The Enacted Capital Program and Financing Plan (the "Capital Plan") reflects capital spending and debt issuances in FY 2025 through FY 2029. It describes the State's multi-year capital program, the way it will be financed, and the impact of debt on the State's Financial Plan.
