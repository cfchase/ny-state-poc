The following chart shows the savings and costs related to the MTA transactions, as compared to a 30-year bond structure with level debt service. The comparison assumes the actual MTA bond transactions (term beyond 30 years) and the hypothetical 30-year bond transactions are issued on the same day and interest rate environment.

Savings (Years 1-30) $676 million

## **Actual Debt Service on MTA Projects Compared to 30-Year Level Debt Service**

Savings Invested at 5.2% $1.2 billion

Costs (Years 31-40) $1.8 billion

## **Costs**

As shown in the illustration, the cost differential of issuing 40-year bonds would be offset if the benefit of investing short-term savings is included in the comparison and the State earns interest at the current Short-Term Investment Pool (STIP) rate. Specifically, the comparison shows that financing MTA assets for longer than 30 years provided an estimated total of $676 million in debt service savings over the first 30 years, but added an estimated $1.8 billion in additional debt service costs in years 31 through 40. If the savings in the first 30 years were invested annually at a rate of 5.2%, it would produce an additional $1.2 billion in savings and the transaction would break even.
