 State-related debt service, adjusting for prepayments, has averaged $6.1 billion annually over the past ten years. In FY 2024, the State paid $6.0 billion for debt service costs, or 2.6 percent of All Funds Receipts.

 From 2005 to the present, the State has not borrowed to fund a deficit, despite enduring two severe economic contractions (the Great Recession and the pandemic). This is the longest stretch without deficit borrowing since 1939 - 1972.

Future projections of debt affordability measures from FY 2025 through FY 2029 reflect a growth in bond issuances commensurate with increased capital spending estimates. If capital spending is lower than expected, debt outstanding and debt service estimates would also be lower.

 State-supported debt outstanding is projected to remain under the statutory debt cap over the Capital Plan period, declining to an estimated low point of $800 million in remaining debt capacity in FY 2029. Debt cap calculations exclude all issuances from FY 2021 and FY 2022.

 Adjusted State-related debt service as a share of All Funds Receipts is projected to increase from 2.6 percent in FY 2024 to 3.5 percent in FY 2029. Debt service is adjusted for prepayments to reflect when payments are contractually due.

 State-related debt outstanding as a percentage of personal income is expected to increase from 3.5 percent in FY 2024 to 4.8 percent in FY 2029. This includes the RRIF Loan to fund the State's contribution to the Hudson Tunnel Project.
