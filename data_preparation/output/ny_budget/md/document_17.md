 Authorizing the transfer of up to $500 million from DRRF that could be used to reduce the State's debt burden, maintain bond capacity under the State's debt caps, or meet other Financial Plan goals. Potential DRRF uses include paying down existing debt and providing cash financing for capital projects that would otherwise be funded with debt.

 Continuing to sell a minimum of 50 percent of new debt issuances on a competitive basis in FY 2025, market conditions permitting. Issuing bonds on a competitive basis (a) lowers borrowing costs, (b) provides an essential benchmark for bonds sold on a negotiated basis, and (c) increases transparency related to the bond sale process. The State issued $8.2 billion of bonds in FY 2024, of which 26 percent were issued on a competitive basis. Over the past five years, the State has issued 47 percent of its bonds competitively, generating significant savings.

 Dedicating PAYGO resources in lieu of borrowing. The last three Enacted Budget Financial Plans have included $10 billion of cash resources for PAYGO capital spending, enabling the State to:

o Avoid higher cost taxable debt issuances;

o Avoid issuing debt for capital expenditures with short economic useful lives;

o Meet the increased funding needs for the multi-year transportation capital plan; and

o Maintain affordable debt levels.
