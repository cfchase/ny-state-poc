The DHBTF had a financing gap, or deficit, of $85 million in FY 2024. Gaps are projected to average $562 million in the outyears, for a total gap of $2.8 billion from FY 2025 through FY 2029. These projections are based upon estimates of revenues, bond proceeds, transfers, debt service, and program disbursements. Gap estimates are the result of an imbalance in the DHBTF between projected revenues and expenditures.
