## **$^{ }$Variable Rate Exposure**

The State's variable rate exposure is expected to average 0.1 percent of outstanding debt from FY 2025 through FY 2029. The debt that is counted against the variable rate cap represents the State's unhedged variable rate bonds. The State continues to evaluate the utilization of variable rate debt as part of the debt portfolio, but has no current plans to issue variable rate bonds.

## **Interest Rate Exchange Agreements (Swaps)**

In FY 2022 the State took advantage of favorable market conditions to terminate all remaining swaps outstanding. The State used this opportunity to eliminate the inherent risks associated with swaps, including basis risk, tax risk, counterparty risk, and liquidity risk. The following table shows the calculation of the State's interest rate exchange statutory cap. Currently, there are no interest rate exchange agreements outstanding, and the State is not currently considering the use of new swaps.

## **Bond Caps**

Bond caps provide the legal authorizations to issue bonds to finance a portion of the State's Capital Plan. Bond caps can finance a single year's appropriations or can be for multi-year periods. As the bond cap for a particular programmatic purpose is reached, subsequent legislative changes are required to raise the statutory caps to the level necessary to meet the bondable capital needs. A total of $13.7 billion of increased bond authorizations are included in the Capital Plan. The following table details the bond cap authorizations for all State-supported debt, including legislative actions included in the Capital Plan.
