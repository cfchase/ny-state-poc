The State debt projections from FY 2025 to FY 2029 reflect a 9.8 percent average annual increase in debt levels and 4.1 percent average annual increase in statewide personal income. As a result, debt as a percentage of personal income is expected to increase over the five-year Plan period, from 3.9 percent in FY 2025 to 4.8 percent in FY 2029.

Over a longer time horizon, State-related debt outstanding as a percentage of personal income is projected to drop from 5.0 percent in FY 2015 to 4.8 percent in FY 2029. This decline can be largely attributed to the retirement of State debt, which has accelerated over the past three years due to early retirement (defeasance) of debt due to prepayments. Over the last ten-years debt has remained virtually the same at $54.3 billion and personal income grew at 4.0 percent annually, which has resulted in debt to PI declining to 3.5 percent today.

The following table compares the State's debt as a percentage of personal income to other peer states and the U.S. average.

## **State Debt Outstanding**

From 2010 to 2020, State debt outstanding fell by .05%. This was the first absolute decline in debt measured over a census decade (i.e., ten-year periods starting in years ending in zero) since 1880. State debt has remained flat since 2020.

Adjusted for inflation, the State's debt level is roughly the same as it was in 1982.
