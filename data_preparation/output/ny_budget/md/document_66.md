 Clean Water, Weatherization, and Resiliency ($3.2 billion);

 Broadband Access (up to $800 million); and

 Airports ($685 million).

Additionally, the State was allocated $346 million from the Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund, which was included in the ARPA. This funding is expected to be used to support the ConnectALL initiative to provide affordable broadband access to New York residents in rural and urban areas.

Finally, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA," PL 117-169), which was signed into law in August 2022, makes New York (and other State's, municipalities, and tax-exempt entities and organizations) eligible to receive the value of new and extended clean energy tax credits as elective payments. This program provides funding for clean energy production and investment projects, including:

 Installation of energy facilities (e.g. biogas projects, solar);

 Conversion of vehicle fleets to electric/hybrid;

 EV charging station deployment;

 Use of renewable fuels, such as biodiesel; and

 Energy efficient building design and construction.

The State is currently reviewing projects recently placed into service, as well as future projects, for eligibility under the program to assist in meeting the State's climate goals.

## **DEBT OVERVIEW**

State debt levels, as measured by common benchmarks, are summarized below. All measures reflect the total level of State-related debt issued for all State purposes as described in the "Introduction" section of this Plan. In order to provide consistent comparisons, debt service has been adjusted to reflect prepayments. In addition, FY 2021 debt service excludes repayment of $4.4 billion of PIT notes which provided short-term liquidity for the State. Such adjustments and exclusions have been noted accordingly.
