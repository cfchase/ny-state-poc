## **Capital and Debt Management**

$^{ }$The Capital Plan addresses several issues in the capital and debt program area, specifically:

 Continuing the ability to use the design-build procurement method, which allows design and construction services to be contracted by a single entity, to create savings due to faster delivery of projects. Pursuant to the New York State Infrastructure Investment Act, NYSTA, DOT, OPRHP, NYCHA, DEC, DASNY, ESD, OGS, SUCF, ORDA, the BPCA, and the State Bridge Authority, along with other specific projects (including the replacement of the Rikers Island Jail Complex and the reconstruction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway), are all authorized to utilize design-build as a procurement method. Additionally, both the PANYNJ and GDC are authorized to procure design and construction services using alternative delivery methods.

 Executing $20.5 billion of prepayments of future year debt service payments since FY 2021 has enabled debt to be retired early. The prepayments provide a multi-year benefit to the Financial Plan. The following table shows the impact of prepayments on annual debt service costs.
