Over the Capital Plan period, State-related debt outstanding is projected to increase from $54.3 billion in FY 2024 to $91.0 billion in FY 2029, or an average increase of 11 percent annually. This reflects the impact from the reduction in debt outstanding due to large prepayments over the past four years and the $1.3 billion State service contract with GDC.

## **$^{ }$Debt Issuances**

Debt issuances totaling $7.5 billion are planned to finance capital project spending in FY 2025, an increase of $2.2 billion (43 percent) from FY 2024. The year over year growth is largely attributable to increased capital spending which is projected for FY 2025. Bond issuances in FY 2025 will finance capital commitments for economic development and housing ($1.6 billion), education ($1.3 billion), the environment ($683 million), health and mental hygiene ($813 million), State facilities and equipment ($429 million), and transportation ($2.6 billion).

Over the five-year Capital Plan, new debt issuances are projected to total $46.3 billion. This reflects the application of $10 billion of PAYGO to supplant bond issuances, including $1 billion added in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget Financial Plan. New issuances are expected for economic development and housing ($10.2 billion), education facilities ($7.8 billion), the environment ($4.2 billion), mental hygiene and health care facilities ($5.0 billion), State facilities and equipment ($2.7 billion), and transportation infrastructure ($16.4 billion).
