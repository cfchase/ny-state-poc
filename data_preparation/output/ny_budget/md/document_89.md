Only M/WBEs certified by ESD are used to fulfill goals on 100-percent State-funded projects and/or goods and services. Only SDVOBs certified by the OGS SDVOB Development Office are used to fulfill goals on 100-percent State-funded projects and/or goods and services. For projects that are eligible for Federal funding, the Department is one of four agencies in the New York State Unified Certification Program that are authorized to certify businesses as DBEs, which is a Federal (USDOT) certification program. The other three certifying partners are the MTA, NFTA, and PANYNJ.

The Department establishes annual goals for M/WBE participation that support the State's 30 percent goal. Regulations require a 6 percent SDVOB participation goal for construction contracts, professional service agreements (including civil engineering), and for the procurement of goods and services. The Department reviews these goals and takes appropriate measures to help ensure attainment, including the removal of barriers to participating in NYSDOT contracts. These goals are based on projected opportunities and the availability of certified M/WBEs and SDVOB's in relation to the projected areas of opportunity. The Department submits its Annual M/WBE Goal Plan to the director of the State Division of Minority and Women Business Development. The Department submits its Annual SDVOB Goal Plan to the director of the ServiceDisabled Veteran Owned Business Development Office.
