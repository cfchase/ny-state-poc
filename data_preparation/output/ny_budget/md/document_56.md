General government capital spending in FY 2025 includes: construction, rehabilitation, consolidation, and renovation of State office buildings to maintain asset value, achieve space efficiencies, and reduce operational costs; an ongoing commitment to sustainability through the procurement of zero-emission light duty vehicles; systems modernization projects to enhance agency workflow and accessibility; and IT systems modernization and improvement efforts designed to implement enterprise solutions that enhance service delivery.

Spending for OGS will continue to support State facilities capital projects. The FY 2025 Enacted Budget continues to invest funding in State government facility infrastructure projects including:

 Various ESP infrastructure projects to address natural deterioration that causes recurring mechanical failures, structural vulnerabilities, and power outages;

 Renovation of the State Capitol roof and courtyard;

 Recurring maintenance funding to address projects across the State; and

 Repair and rehabilitation of the Shirley Chisholm State Office Building in Brooklyn.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget also provides funding for the ongoing electrification of the State fleet by 2035. This annual funding is estimated to grow as the percentage of zero-emission vehicles purchased by the State increases through 2035.

Spending for ITS will continue the State's technology consolidation and improvement efforts, as prioritized through the IT governance process.
