## **State Debt Detail**

The tables that follow provide a comprehensive listing of all current and projected State debt outstanding, debt service costs, debt retirements, and new debt issuances.

State-related debt levels reported in the tables are cash-basis amounts that are consistent with the GAAP basis debt levels reported in the ACFR. Thus, the tables reflect all debt issued by the State (including blended component units) for Government activities and Business-type activities as defined in the ACFR.

The tables do not include debt that is issued by, or on behalf of, local governments that may be funded in part by State assistance and grants or aid payments. However, such debt is reflected in the respective financial statements of the local governments responsible for the issuance of such debt.
