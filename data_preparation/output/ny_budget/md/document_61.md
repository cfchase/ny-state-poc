## **Financing Sources of Capital Projects Spending**

The State issues bonds (both directly and through public authorities) and uses Federal and State PAYGO resources to finance capital spending. All bonds issued through public authorities on behalf of the State are approved by the Legislature, on behalf of the people. Since 1976, all Staterelated debt, except General Obligation Bonds, has been subject to more rigorous approval processes, including PACB and authority boards. The amounts for All Governmental Funds spending include both those capital project disbursements that are reflected in the Comptroller's accounting system, and those disbursements which would have formerly been made directly from bond proceeds which had been reflected only in GAAP accounting statements. Over the plan, 52 percent of capital spending is projected to be financed with authority-issued bonds and General Obligation Bonds, and 48 percent is projected to be financed with State and Federal PAYGO resources.

## **$^{ }$Authority Bond Financing**

The State's PIT Revenue Bonds and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, the State's principal vehicles for financing capital projects, are currently issued by three public authorities, DASNY, ESD and NYSTA, on behalf of the State. Other State-supported bonds, excluding General Obligation Bonds, have been issued by public authorities in prior years.

Authority bond-financed capital spending is reimbursed from the proceeds of bonds sold by State public authorities pursuant to contractual agreements with the State. Reimbursements are managed to maximize efficient financing of capital projects from State resources. Factors affecting the timing of reimbursement of State expenditures include the availability of existing bond proceeds, bond market access, investment terms, and State cash flow considerations.

Over the Capital Plan period, approximately 49 percent of total spending will be financed with authority bond proceeds. The State expects to use State PIT and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds as the financing vehicles for the vast majority of bond-financed spending.
