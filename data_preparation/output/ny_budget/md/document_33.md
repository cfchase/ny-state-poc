## **Annual Capital Spending Disbursements and Debt Impacts**

The following sections summarize total capital spending from new and existing appropriations included in the Capital Plan and the related impact on State debt.

## **CAPITAL PROGRAM AND FINANCING PLAN**

In FY 2025, transportation and transit spending is projected to total $7.5 billion, which represents 43 percent of total capital spending. Economic development spending accounts for 13 percent, higher education spending accounts for 11 percent, and spending related to parks and the environment represents 12 percent. The remaining 21 percent comprises spending for health care, mental hygiene, social welfare, public protection, education, general government, and the all other category, which includes Special Infrastructure Account spending.

Overall transportation and transit spending is projected to increase by $1.4 billion (22 percent) from FY 2024 to FY 2025. The growth is attributable to projected increased spending by DOT for the continuation of major road and bridge projects as well as the continuation of the State's $3.1 billion contribution to the MTA's 2020-24 Capital Plan.

Parks and environment spending is estimated to increase by $377 million (22 percent) in FY 2025, primarily reflecting the continued phase-in of the $5.5 billion clean water drinking grants program, increased capital support for State parks, NY SWIMS, and spending from the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Bond Act.
