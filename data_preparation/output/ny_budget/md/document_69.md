## **DETAILED DATA**

## **Variable Rate Exposure and Interest Rate Exchange Agreements**

Article 5-D of the State Finance Law authorizes the use of a limited amount of variable rate obligations and interest rate exchange agreements ("swaps"). The statute was implemented as a debt management tool to lower debt service costs, diversify the State's debt portfolio and to better match variable rate debt exposure to variable rate earnings on the State's short-term investments. Issuers of State-supported bonds may enter variable rate debt instruments that result in a maximum net variable rate exposure of 15 percent of State-supported debt. Issuers may also enter into interest rate exchange agreements in a total notional amount that does not exceed 15 percent of State-supported debt, subject to various criteria established in the statute to reduce risk.
