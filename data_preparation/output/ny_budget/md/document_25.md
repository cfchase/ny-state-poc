The State expects to retire $594 million of debt in FY 2025, approximately $767 million (56 percent) less than in FY 2024. The decrease in retirements is largely due to prior prepayments, which resulted in the early retirement (defeasance) of $3.0 billion of bonds that had been scheduled to retire in FY 2025. Additional retirements beyond the level projected in FY 2025 are possible through debt management actions. Debt retirements are projected to average $2.2 billion annually over the Capital Plan period.

## **Debt Service**

State-related debt service is projected at $3.0 billion in FY 2025, a decrease of $4.0 billion (57 percent) from FY 2024, which is affected by the prepayment of $4.7 billion in FY 2024 of future debt service costs and additional prepayments in previous fiscal years. Adjusting for prepayments, State-related debt service is projected at $6.7 billion in FY 2025, an increase of 12 percent from FY 2024. Over the five-year Capital Plan, adjusted debt service costs are expected to grow to $8.7 billion in FY 2029, an average annual increase of 6.6 percent.
