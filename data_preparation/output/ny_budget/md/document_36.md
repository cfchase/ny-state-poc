The State expects to issue $7.5 billion in debt during FY 2025 to finance existing and newly authorized capital program initiatives. Economic development and transportation projects are projected to represent approximately 57 percent of new issuances. The remaining balance is divided among education, environmental facilities, health care and mental hygiene facilities, and State facilities. The State uses three credits - PIT Revenue Bonds, Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, and General Obligation Bonds - to finance capital projects.

The State plans to sell at least 50 percent of bonds on a competitive basis in FY 2025, market conditions permitting. Issuing bonds on a competitive basis (a) lowers borrowing costs, (b) provides an essential benchmark for bonds sold on a negotiated basis, and (c) increases transparency related to the bond sale process. The State issued $8.2 billion in FY 2024, with 26 percent being issued on a competitive basis. These sales provided consistently low interest costs compared to negotiated bond sales, as well as lower issuance costs.

**The $7**5 billion of new issuances are expected to be sold through multiple bond sales scheduled for FY 2025 including, $5.3 billion of PIT Revenue Bonds, $1.8 billion of Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, and $458 million of General Obligation Bonds.

The following pie charts provide a distribution of projected debt issuances for new capital projects in FY 2025 by both functional area and financing program.

## **FY 2025 Debt Retirements**

Retirements represent the annual repayment of principal for State-related debt. Retirements are recorded as of the date payment is due to bondholders, rather than the actual date the State makes the cash payment. For example, if principal payments are due on April 1, the bonds are considered outstanding on March 31, even if the State is contractually obligated to make payments to the bond trustee prior to that date.

The rate at which State-related debt is retired or paid off has an impact on the State's ability to recycle debt capacity to finance new capital projects. Relatively faster amortization frees up debt capacity but increases debt service costs in the State operating budget. Over time the practice of retiring debt more quickly increases the State's debt service burden at the expense of other purposes.

| Period   | Cumulative Percentage of Existing Debt to  be Retired 1 |
| 5 years  | 14%                                                     |
| 10 years | 40%                                                     |
| 15 years | 59%                                                     |
| 20 years | 77%                                                     |
| 25 years | 92%                                                     |
| 30 years | 98%                                                     |
| 40 years | 100%                                                    |

Over the next five years, retirements of State-related debt are projected to average $2.2 billion annually. Retirements projected in FY 2025 of $594 million are substantially below the annual average due to the early retirement of bonds as part of debt prepayments. The following pie charts provide a distribution of projected debt retirements for FY 2025 by both functional area and financing program.
