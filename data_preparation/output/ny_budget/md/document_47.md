## **Social Welfare**

Capital spending for social welfare supports HHAP grants administered by OTDA, the preservation and maintenance of youth facilities operated by OCFS, and programs administered by HCR to create and preserve affordable housing units across the State.

The Capital Plan continues the multi-year $25 billion investment to create and preserve 100,000 affordable homes, including 10,000 homes with supportive services for vulnerable populations, and to electrify an additional 50,000 homes. The Capital Plan also includes funding to support capital improvements at OCFS Youth Facilities.
