Capital projects spending from State appropriations is projected at $17.7 billion in FY 2025 and is expected to be financed with State-supported debt ($6.4 billion, 37 percent); State cash resources ($7.8 billion, 44 percent); and Federal aid ($3.4 billion, 19 percent). Transportation and transit capital spending accounts for $7.5 billion or 43 percent of total projected spending in FY 2025. PAYGO resources dedicated to funding capital spending are expected to increase by 26 percent to $11.3 billion in FY 2025, from $8.9 billion in FY 2024.

Capital spending is projected to increase by 20 percent in FY 2025. This is primarily attributable to increased investments in economic development, and continuation of the five-year capital plans for housing and transportation. Over the next five years capital spending is expected to average $18.8 billion annually.

## **$^{ }$Debt Summary**

The State's debt burden (i.e., debt outstanding and annual debt service costs) is affected by the amount of bond-financed capital spending included in the Capital Plan (issuances), how rapidly debt is repaid (retirements), and the market interest rates at the time bonds are sold. In order to maintain affordable debt costs, DOB has longstanding debt practices, which include:

 Level Debt Service: State bond issuances are structured to achieve equal debt service payments in each year;

 Generational Equity: bonds are issued over the blended useful lives of the assets being financed in each sale ensuring that the generations that benefit from an asset are responsible for paying for an asset;
