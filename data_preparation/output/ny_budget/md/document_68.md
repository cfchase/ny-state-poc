## **Debt Service**

After adjusting for debt service prepayments, debt service costs from FY 2025 through FY 2029 are projected to increase by an average of 6.6 percent annually, while All Funds receipts are projected to increase by an average of 1.7 percent through FY 2029. Thus, debt service costs are projected to be about 3.5 percent of the All Funds budget in FY 2029 due to the issuance of bonds to finance the State's capital needs.

**The 0**5 percent average annual rate of growth in adjusted debt service from FY 2015 through FY 2025 is lower than the growth in inflation of 2.9 percent and the 4.7 percent growth in State revenue during that same time period.

*Adjusted for prepayments

Debt service growth after adjusting for prepayments is projected to average roughly 6.6 percent in the forecast period due to continued support for the State's capital program. If capital spends closer to historical levels, the projected growth in State debt service will be significantly less than shown below.
