## INTRODUCTION

The DOB 1 publishes the Capital Program and Financing Plan twice a year, with the Executive Budget and the Enacted Budget. The Enacted Capital Program and Financing Plan (the "Capital Plan") reflects capital spending and debt issuances in FY 2025 through FY 2029. It describes the State's multi-year capital program, the way it will be financed, and the impact of debt on the State's Financial Plan.

Factors affecting the State's financial condition are numerous and complex. This Capital Plan contains "forward-looking statements" relating to future results and economic performance as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Since many factors may materially affect fiscal and economic conditions in the State, the forecasts, projections, and estimates should not be regarded as a representation that actual results will not vary. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on the State's expectations at the time they were prepared and are necessarily dependent upon assumptions, estimates, calculations and data that it believes are reasonable as of the date made, but that may be incorrect, incomplete or imprecise or not reflective of actual results. Forecasts, projections, and estimates are not intended as representations of fact or guarantees of results. The words "expects," "forecasts," "projects," "intends," "anticipates," "estimates," "calculates," "assumes" and analogous expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Any such statements inherently are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from projections. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general economic and business conditions; natural calamities; foreign hostilities or wars; domestic or foreign terrorism; changes in political, social, economic and environmental conditions, including climate change and extreme weather events; epidemics or pandemics; cybersecurity events; impediments to the implementation of gap-closing actions; regulatory initiatives and compliance with governmental regulations; litigation; Federal tax law changes; actions by the Federal government to reduce or disallow expected aid, including Federal aid authorized or appropriated by Congress, but subject to sequestration, administrative actions, or other actions that would reduce aid to the State; and various other events, conditions and circumstances. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond the control of the State. These forward-looking statements are based on the State's expectations as of the date of this Capital Plan.

The Capital Plan consists of six major sections as follows:

 The Executive Summary summarizes the State's capital initiatives, multi-year capital spending and financing sources, limitations on State debt, and debt issuance plans.

 FY 2025 Capital Program and Financing Plan provides estimates of annual capital spending and debt by program area and financing source.

 Five-Year Capital Plan provides a summary of the multi-year impact of the Capital Plan and describes agency capital goals, objectives, and capital maintenance efforts.

 Debt Overview includes information on the State's bond programs and on the State's actual and projected debt levels and debt service costs, as well as comparisons to objective affordability measures.

 Detailed Data explains various State debt limitations and provides detailed tables on capital projects financing, State-related debt, and debt service costs.

 Agency Summary and Detail Tables provide a summary of projected appropriations, commitments, and disbursements for each agency on both a comprehensive construction program and capital projects fund basis.

Terminology used throughout the Capital Plan includes "commitment(s)," meaning the amount an agency expects to place under contract for a given fiscal year; and "appropriation(s)," referring to the statutory authorization against which expenditures (liability) and disbursements (cash) may be made during a specific State fiscal year. In general, appropriations are the legal authority which allows State agencies to spend money. Agency appropriations, commitments, and disbursements data can be found in the Agency Summary and Detail Tables section.

Additionally, the Capital Plan makes references to "off-budget" spending, which refers to capital spending that is occurring directly from bond proceeds held at public authorities. Off-budget spending requires an enacted appropriation, bonding authorization, and PACB approval to occur. However, in an effort to streamline all State capital spending within the Capital Plan, the State is converting all such spending to "on-budget" spending. This transition began in FY 2015 with the conversion of the local highway transportation program and the only remaining off-budget spending is for SED's EXCEL program.

## Reporting on State Debt

The Capital Plan provides information on State-supported debt and the broader measure of Staterelated debt:

State-supported debt represents bonds or notes of the State that are paid from traditional State resources (e.g., tax revenue) and have a budgetary impact. It includes both General Obligation debt approved directly by the voters, and debt authorized by the Legislature, acting on behalf of the people, and issued on behalf of the State by public authorities, where the State is contractually obligated to pay debt service, subject to appropriation. All debt authorized by the Legislature must be approved by PACB, and the board of the issuing authority, with the exception of General Obligation Bonds. The State's debt reform caps on debt outstanding and debt service apply to State-supported debt except for FY 2021 and FY 2022 when the caps were suspended.

State-related debt is a broader measure that includes State-supported debt, State-guaranteed debt, moral obligation financings, and certain contingent-contractual obligation financings, where debt service is paid from non-State sources in the first instance, and State appropriations are available, but typically not expected to be needed, to make payments. This category also includes inter-governmental loans, where no bonds are issued but the State has agreed to pay annual loan payments to another governmental entity. The classification is made at the time of the original issuance.

State debt is reported in the Capital Plan on a cash basis and includes all debt issued by the State and public authorities acting on its behalf for government activities and business-type activities as defined in the ACFR.

State debt does not include debt that is issued by State public authorities for which the State has no financial obligation (i.e., "conduit debt"), or debt issued by or on behalf of local governments and secured (in whole or in part) by State assistance and grants aid payments. For example, certain school districts and NYC have pledged State aid to help pay debt service for locally sponsored and locally determined financings. Additionally, certain of the State's public authorities issue debt supported by non-State resources (i.e., NYSTA toll revenue bonds, TBTA or MTA revenue bonds, or DASNY dormitory facilities revenue bonds) or issue debt on behalf of private clients (e.g., DASNY hospital revenue bonds). Because this debt was not issued by, or on behalf of, the State, the State has no obligation to pay debt service, and it is not considered State debt in the ACFR. Therefore, it is not included in the Capital Plan. Instead, this debt is accounted for in the respective financial statements of the local governments responsible for the issuance of such debt.

Additional information about the State's debt portfolio is available on DOB's public website (New York State Division of the Budget). The Investor's Guide section of the site contains detailed information on New York State bonds including: variable rate capacity reports, PIT and Sales Tax Revenue Bond debt service and debt outstanding, credit ratings on New York State bonds, and the State's bond issuance schedule.

## Enacted Budget Capital Plan Overview

## The FY 2025 Enacted Capital Plan:

 Makes priority investments in mental health, public safety, resiliency, high-technology manufacturing and research and development, and housing. The FY 2025 Enacted Capital Plan also continues investments across the State including: five-year capital plans for transportation and housing; the Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Bond Act; investments in clean water infrastructure; health care transformation funding; a comprehensive plan to deliver broadband access; increased support for SUNY and CUNY; and continuing regional economic development and community revitalization projects.

 Invests in projects to improve the State's transit systems, modernize airports, and rebuild infrastructure to upgrade the State's transportation network. Several projects are expected to be financed from multiple funding sources and administered by public authorities (e.g., MTA, PANYNJ) outside of the State budget. Funding partners for these projects include the State, local governments, the Federal government, public authorities, and private entities. The FY 2025 Enacted Budget supports the State share of funding for these projects. Major infrastructure projects underway with funding partners are shown in the table below.

 Leverages ongoing Federal infrastructure funding. The Plan utilizes funding from the Federal infrastructure bills, IIJA and ARPA, to support new infrastructure investments, primarily for road and bridge projects, environmental programs, and broadband access.

 Maintains affordable debt levels while making significant capital investments. Specific actions taken by the State include:

o Sized capital investments to fit within the State's statutory debt limit over the 5-year period by prioritizing capital investments to maintain an affordable Capital Plan.

o Added $10 billion of cash resources, including an increase of $1 billion in the Enacted Budget, for PAYGO capital spending to improve debt affordability. This funding is being used to avoid the issuance of debt, by allowing the State to use cash to supplant borrowing for both higher-cost taxable debt and assets with short economic useful lives. The reduction in debt issuances provides both debt service savings and debt cap relief.

o Transitioned personnel costs at DASNY and OGS, which total $40 million annually and relate to managing State construction projects for OMH, OPWDD and OASAS, from bond-financing to PAYGO (cash) beginning in FY 2025.

o Initiated $20.5 billion of debt prepayments in FYs 2021 - 2024 to enable the State to retire debt early.

o Generated $427 million of present value savings in FY 2024 by refinancing debt, which takes advantage of lower interest rates.

o Reduced the BIC, a fee assessed on most State public authority bond issues, from $8.40 per bond to $3.50 per bond and eliminated BIC on refundings. This will lower the cost of issuing debt and generate long-term debt service savings for the State.

 Reflects the positive impact of managing the State's debt burden responsibly for decades.

o New York's credit rating of AA+ is at its highest level since 1972. The State has two highly-rated revenue credits and GO Bonds that are in high demand by investors.

o At 3.5 percent, New York's debt "burden" as measured as a share of State personal income is at its lowest level in 60 years. This is true even though the State intervened to assist the MTA during the pandemic and issued $6.1 billion in debt on its behalf.

o The State ended FY 2024 with debt outstanding of $54.3 billion which is virtually unchanged from debt outstanding 10-years prior. Adjusted for inflation, the State's debt level today is roughly the same as it was in 1982.

## Enacted Budget Capital Plan Highlights

The Capital Plan funds the capital activities of State agencies in a fiscally responsible manner while maintaining affordable levels of debt. Capital spending, which is projected to total $17.7 billion in FY 2025, includes investments for roadways, bridges, and transit systems; affordable and supportive housing units; economic development projects; health care facilities; and environmental protection projects. Additionally, the Capital Plan continues funding for State parks, and educational, mental health, and correctional facilities.

Major capital initiatives added or continued in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget include:

 Five-Year Department of Transportation Capital Plan. The Enacted Budget includes approximately $7.7 billion for the third year of a five-year, $33 billion DOT capital plan. The DOT capital plan leverages Federal funding commitments made in the IIJA to support the final phases of major infrastructure projects, including the Hunts Point Interstate Access Improvement and the replacement of I-81 in Syracuse. The new plan also supports new large-scale projects, including: modernizing the Livingston Avenue Bridge in Albany; reconnecting neighborhoods across the Kensington Expressway in Buffalo; converting Route 17 to I-86 in Orange and Sullivan Counties; and assessing ways to improve road capacity at the Oakdale Merge in Suffolk County. The DOT Capital Plan also includes $1 billion for the "Bridge NY" program and $1 billion for the Pave Our Potholes program, and continues funding commitments to local highway and bridge programs.

 Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project. The Enacted Budget includes the resources that are expected to be needed to make annual payments to fund the State's commitment for the Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project starting in FY 2025.

The Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project consists of three elements: (i) a new two-track tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey; (ii) the Hudson Yards Concrete Casing; and (iii) the rehabilitation of the existing Amtrak North River Tunnel under the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey. Funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project was originally expected to be split equally between the Federal government (50 percent) and the local sponsors (50 percent), consistent with a 2015 framework agreement among the Federal government, the PANYNJ, New York State and the State of New Jersey. However, additional Federal funding subsequently reduced the local sponsors' share. The January 2024 financial plan for the Gateway Hudson Tunnel Project reflected an estimated total project cost of $16.0 billion, with the local funding commitment for construction costs totaling $4.3 billion, or 27 percent, allocated among the State of New Jersey, the State of New York and the PANYNJ. New York State's capital commitment for the Hudson Tunnel Project is expected to be funded with a USDOT RRIF loan obtained by the GDC, a bi-state public authority. The State expects to make annual payments to the GDC equal to the principal and interest on the RRIF loan as the same shall become due. Such payments are subject to annual appropriation by the State Legislature. The State has no plans to issue State-supported debt to fund its annual payment obligation to GDC. The maximum annual payments on the RRIF loan are not expected to exceed $83 million when fully annualized. Such payments are expected to be substantially lower during the

construction period, with the initial payments beginning in FY 2025, consistent with the terms of the RRIF loan. The following table shows the costs to repay the RRIF annual loan payments as estimated in the January 2024 financial plan. Initial debt service costs relate to ongoing annual fees associated with the RRIF loan. Principal and interest payments on the loan are projected to commence in FY 2034 after substantial completion of the project.

Prior Enacted Budgets included legislation that authorizes the Budget Director to enter into a financing agreement with the GDC to make debt service payments on the RRIF loan, subject to annual appropriation by the State Legislature. With this legislative authorization, the State Budget Director will enter into a contractual obligation with the GDC that obligates the State to seek appropriations annually in future budgets and, if appropriated, to provide to the GDC an amount each year sufficient to make all payments on the RRIF loan. Such payments are expected to be funded from the State's General Fund. The legislation also includes the authorization to set aside funds quarterly in advance of payments due to GDC for the Hudson Tunnel Project.

 Pennsylvania Station Area Civic and Land Use Improvement Project. The State has completed the transformation of the James A. Farley Post Office building into the Moynihan Train Hall and opened an expanded West End Concourse at Penn Station. The concourse provides direct access to 17 of the station's 21 tracks for LIRR commuters and intercity rail passengers, offering an underground connection between the Moynihan Train Hall and Penn Station via 33rd Street with a direct link to the 8th Avenue Subway (A/C/E Trains).

Expanding on this vision, Governor Hochul plans to create a commuter-first Penn Station, the busiest transit hub in the Western Hemisphere. The reconstructed Penn Station is expected to create an extensive, natural light-filled train hall that more than doubles passenger space from 123,000 square feet to 250,000 square feet and nearly doubles the number of entrances from 12 to 20. The station reconstruction complements a station expansion that will increase track and train capacity by 40 percent to more effectively accommodate the service needs of travelers and commuters. Project costs are estimated at $22 billion.

 MTA 2020-2024 Capital Program. The Enacted Budget continues the State's $3.1 billion contribution to the $52.1 billion MTA 2020-2024 capital program. The program prioritizes investments to revitalize the subway system, including improving signal technology, increasing accessibility, and addressing quality of life issues. The capital program also makes investments in LIRR and Metro North Railroad commuter rail and bus service upgrades. The FY 2025 Enacted Budget also includes funding for future MTA capital projects, including: $52 million to advance design and engineering for the Interborough Express; $16 million for a feasibility study, environmental review, and preliminary engineering for the potential westward expansion of the Second Avenue Subway; and $20 million to advance a study, environmental review, and preliminary construction work to improve resiliency on the Metro North Hudson River Line.

 Transforming John F. Kennedy Airport. The State continues to invest in the $19.5 billion plan to transform JFK Airport through an overhaul of the airport's eight disparate terminal sites into one unified JFK Airport. Work will include demolishing old terminals, utilizing vacant space, and modernizing infrastructure. This investment includes $15.6 billion in private sector funding and will increase the airport's capacity by at least 15 million passengers annually. The first new facilities from this ongoing transformation opened in 2023.

 Five-Year Housing Plan. The FY 2025 Budget continues the $25 billion, five-year housing plan to create and preserve 100,000 affordable homes, including 10,000 homes with support services for vulnerable populations, and electrify an additional 50,000 homes as part of the State's plan to electrify one million homes and make another one million homes electrification-ready. Funding includes $5.7 billion in State capital resources, $8.8 billion in State and Federal tax credits and other Federal allocations, and $11 billion to support the operation of shelters and supportive housing units and to provide rental subsidies. Additionally, the FY 2025 Enacted Budget establishes a $500 million fund to support infrastructure upgrades on State properties that could be repurposed to create up to 15,000 housing units.

 Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Bond Act. In November 2022, voters approved a $4.2 billion bond act that will support: capital improvements and enhancements in flood risk reduction/restorations; open space, working lands conservation, and recreation; climate change mitigation; and water quality improvement and resilient infrastructure. The Environmental Bond Act supports various initiatives within the FY 2025 Enacted Budget, including resiliency and land improvement efforts. In September 2023, Governor Hochul released a roadmap for P-12 schools to transition bus fleets to zero-emission vehicles funded, in part, with $500 million from the Environmental Bond Act.

 Climate and Flood Resiliency. The Enacted Budget includes funding for investments to mitigate damage from major flooding events, including: $250 million from the 2022 Environmental Bond Act to promote voluntary home buyouts in communities most vulnerable to flooding; $130 million for Green Resiliency Grants to support flood control infrastructure projects; and $40 million to launch the Resilient and Ready program, which will support low- and moderate-income homeowners with resiliency improvements and assist with repairs after a catastrophic event.

 Clean Water Infrastructure. The Enacted Budget adds $500 million to support clean water infrastructure, raising the State's total investment to $5.5 billion. This funding will support local construction projects to improve municipal drinking water distribution, filtration systems, and wastewater treatment infrastructure.

Additionally, the Enacted Budget includes a new $385 million appropriation for CREST and $100 million for LOCAP, which both support regional and community development.

 Health Care. The State continues to administer $2.6 billion in awards associated with Statewide Health Care Facility Transformation Programs IV and V. This funding has enabled the State to finance capital improvements for eligible health care providers, improve health care delivery, and address information technology improvements. The Enacted Budget also includes $4 million for RPCI to expand their existing mobile cancer screening efforts; $20 million to support capital grants to institutions that research and treat ALS and other rare diseases; and $3 million in recurring capital funding for the EQUAL program.

 Higher Education. The Enacted Budget proposes $1.4 billion in new capital funding for SUNY and CUNY, including $1.1 billion to maintain campus facilities and make strategic investments, $150 million for SUNY Hospitals, and $154 million for community colleges.

## Capital and Debt Management

$^{ }$The Capital Plan addresses several issues in the capital and debt program area, specifically:

 Continuing the ability to use the design-build procurement method, which allows design and construction services to be contracted by a single entity, to create savings due to faster delivery of projects. Pursuant to the New York State Infrastructure Investment Act, NYSTA, DOT, OPRHP, NYCHA, DEC, DASNY, ESD, OGS, SUCF, ORDA, the BPCA, and the State Bridge Authority, along with other specific projects (including the replacement of the Rikers Island Jail Complex and the reconstruction of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway), are all authorized to utilize design-build as a procurement method. Additionally, both the PANYNJ and GDC are authorized to procure design and construction services using alternative delivery methods.

 Executing $20.5 billion of prepayments of future year debt service payments since FY 2021 has enabled debt to be retired early. The prepayments provide a multi-year benefit to the Financial Plan. The following table shows the impact of prepayments on annual debt service costs.

 Authorizing the transfer of up to $500 million from DRRF that could be used to reduce the State's debt burden, maintain bond capacity under the State's debt caps, or meet other Financial Plan goals. Potential DRRF uses include paying down existing debt and providing cash financing for capital projects that would otherwise be funded with debt.


<!-- image -->

 Continuing to sell a minimum of 50 percent of new debt issuances on a competitive basis in FY 2025, market conditions permitting. Issuing bonds on a competitive basis (a) lowers borrowing costs, (b) provides an essential benchmark for bonds sold on a negotiated basis, and (c) increases transparency related to the bond sale process. The State issued $8.2 billion of bonds in FY 2024, of which 26 percent were issued on a competitive basis. Over the past five years, the State has issued 47 percent of its bonds competitively, generating significant savings.

 Dedicating PAYGO resources in lieu of borrowing. The last three Enacted Budget Financial Plans have included $10 billion of cash resources for PAYGO capital spending, enabling the State to:

o Avoid higher cost taxable debt issuances;

o Avoid issuing debt for capital expenditures with short economic useful lives;

o Meet the increased funding needs for the multi-year transportation capital plan; and

o Maintain affordable debt levels.

 Lowering issuance costs for public authority bond sales that are subject to the BIC by reducing the BIC to pre-2002 levels of $3.50 per bond. Since its inception in 1989, the BIC has been raised three times to its current level of $8.40 per bond. State PIT and Sales Tax Revenue Bond issuances account for approximately two-thirds of BIC fees annually. The State can expect to save an estimated $3.6 million for every $1 billion in issuances. When applied to State issuances over the 5-Year Plan period, the BIC reduction is estimated to save $160 million in debt service costs. Additionally, eliminating BIC on refundings avoids charging BIC for bonds that already had BIC assessed.

 Authorizes short-term financing for liquidity purposes during the fiscal year. In doing so, it maintains a tool to help the State manage cashflow, if needed, and more effectively deploy resources. Specifically, the authorization allows for the issuance of up to $3 billion of PIT revenue anticipation notes which mature no later than March 31, 2025. Borrowed amounts cannot be extended or refinanced beyond the initial maturity. The Capital Plan does not assume the use of short-term financing for liquidity purposes. DOB evaluates cash results regularly and may adjust the use of notes based on liquidity needs, market considerations, and other factors.

 Amends the enabling statutes for the State's PIT and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds to authorize the redemption of such bonds if it provides a present value savings, as certified by a financial advisor. The requirement for present value savings provides an appropriate objective standard that is common in the municipal finance market.

## Multi-Year Authorization to Finance MTA Assets Up To 50 Years

The State recognizes the important role that the MTA plays in providing affordable, safe, lowcarbon transport to millions of New Yorkers every day. Accordingly, the FY 2025 Enacted Budget includes a 3-year authorization that permits the State to finance MTA assets up to 50 years, still decades short of the useful lives of many MTA assets. For example, the State has financed $2 billion for the East Side Access and Second Avenue Subway projects, which have useful lives of 70 years. This is the fourth consecutive year that the Legislature has worked with the Executive to pass legislation for this purpose and the first multi-year reauthorization. The legislation demonstrates the State's commitment to maintaining a fiscally responsible approach when financing MTA assets.

In FY 2022, the State made a policy shift to finance MTA assets directly because the MTA was not in a position to borrow funds in the municipal bond market during the pandemic. At the same time, the State had substantially increased its contribution to the MTA Capital Plan from less than $1 billion in the 2010-2014 Capital Plan to more than $9 billion for the 2015-2019 Capital Plan. These factors, coupled with the long useful lives of MTA projects, prompted the State to issue PIT and Sales Tax bonds with maturities of up to 40 years to fund its capital contributions for the MTA. The State expects to continue financing MTA assets through the issuance of PIT and Sales Tax bonds with maturities of up to 50 years, provided the useful lives of the assets being financed support it. This approach is reflected in the 5-year Capital Plan.

For nearly a decade, the State has been structuring its transactions, including those with MTA assets beyond 30 years, using a level debt service structure that aligns with the useful life of the assets being financed. The State consolidates the financing of its assets (e.g., buildings, roads, transit facilities) into one transaction and repays the debt service (principal and interest) in equal installments over the blended average useful life of the assets. This is with the guidelines set forth in the NYS Constitution (for General Obligation bonds), State law, and Federal tax law. This level debt structure ensures that the State pays debt back in a fair and timely manner, and applies the principle of generational equity, so that the significant costs incurred to build or reconstruct infrastructure are spread equitably over a time-frame associated with the assets' useful lives.


<!-- image -->

Since the State was first authorized to finance MTA assets for up to 50 years in FY 2022, the State has executed five bond transactions that contain long-lived MTA assets. In these transactions, the State issued a total of $3 billion for MTA purposes - of which approximately $1.5 billion included maturities between 31 and 40 years - in combination with other State projects which were financed with maturities of up to 30 years.


<!-- image -->

All of the transactions containing long-lived MTA assets were structured with level debt service that amortizes debt in equal annual installments, as depicted in the preceding chart. There is no "backloaded" debt service for any of the transactions containing MTA assets. Longer maturities for MTA assets in years 31-40 increase total debt service costs when the debt is repaid with interest but fairly align debt service costs with the generations that will benefit from the assets. In addition, there is a present value benefit of saving money in the early years (years: 1-30) before incurring higher costs later (years: 31-40).

The following chart shows the savings and costs related to the MTA transactions, as compared to a 30-year bond structure with level debt service. The comparison assumes the actual MTA bond transactions (term beyond 30 years) and the hypothetical 30-year bond transactions are issued on the same day and interest rate environment.

Savings (Years 1-30) $676 million

Savings

## Actual Debt Service on MTA Projects Compared to 30-Year Level Debt Service

Savings Invested at 5.2% $1.2 billion

Costs (Years 31-40) $1.8 billion

## Costs

As shown in the illustration, the cost differential of issuing 40-year bonds would be offset if the benefit of investing short-term savings is included in the comparison and the State earns interest at the current Short-Term Investment Pool (STIP) rate. Specifically, the comparison shows that financing MTA assets for longer than 30 years provided an estimated total of $676 million in debt service savings over the first 30 years, but added an estimated $1.8 billion in additional debt service costs in years 31 through 40. If the savings in the first 30 years were invested annually at a rate of 5.2%, it would produce an additional $1.2 billion in savings and the transaction would break even.

## Capital Projects Spending Overview

Capital projects spending from State appropriations is projected at $17.7 billion in FY 2025 and is expected to be financed with State-supported debt ($6.4 billion, 37 percent); State cash resources ($7.8 billion, 44 percent); and Federal aid ($3.4 billion, 19 percent). Transportation and transit capital spending accounts for $7.5 billion or 43 percent of total projected spending in FY 2025. PAYGO resources dedicated to funding capital spending are expected to increase by 26 percent to $11.3 billion in FY 2025, from $8.9 billion in FY 2024.

Capital spending is projected to increase by 20 percent in FY 2025. This is primarily attributable to increased investments in economic development, and continuation of the five-year capital plans for housing and transportation. Over the next five years capital spending is expected to average $18.8 billion annually.

## $^{ }$Debt Summary

The State's debt burden (i.e., debt outstanding and annual debt service costs) is affected by the amount of bond-financed capital spending included in the Capital Plan (issuances), how rapidly debt is repaid (retirements), and the market interest rates at the time bonds are sold. In order to maintain affordable debt costs, DOB has longstanding debt practices, which include:

 Level Debt Service: State bond issuances are structured to achieve equal debt service payments in each year;

 Generational Equity: bonds are issued over the blended useful lives of the assets being financed in each sale ensuring that the generations that benefit from an asset are responsible for paying for an asset;

 Maximize Tax Exemption: each bond sale is structured to comply with IRS rules to maximize the amount of bonds that can be financed on a tax exempt basis, the lowest cost of borrowing available to the State. In addition, when possible, the State dedicates PAYGO resources to avoid the issuance of taxable bonds.

 Limit Risk: the State's debt portfolio has limited variable rate exposure and no derivative (swaps) exposure, which ensures that annual debt costs are not subject to rapid increases in interest rates.

The following debt projections include the debt related to bonds issued prior to FY 2025, as well as estimates of future bonded-capital spending. Capital spending is projected to increase above historic levels over the 5-year plan, which results in higher bond issuances and associated debt service costs. If capital spending is lower than projected in the Capital Plan, debt outstanding and debt service estimates would also be lower.

## Debt Outstanding

State-related debt outstanding is projected to total $62.5 billion in FY 2025, an increase of $8.2 billion (15 percent) from FY 2024. New debt issuances are expected to total $7.5 billion in FY 2025, offset by $594 million in debt retirements. Additionally, debt outstanding reflects the expectation that in FY 2025 the State will finalize a service contract with GDC to pay principal and interest costs related to the $1.3 billion RRIF loan for the Hudson Tunnel Project. Debt outstanding and retirements have also been impacted by large debt prepayments in prior fiscal years. The annual increase in debt outstanding includes $1.6 billion for economic development and housing, $1.0 billion for education facilities, $625 million for environmental facilities, $774 million for health and mental hygiene, $368 million for State facilities and equipment, $2.5 billion for transportation, and $1.3 billion for the Hudson Tunnel Project.

Over the Capital Plan period, State-related debt outstanding is projected to increase from $54.3 billion in FY 2024 to $91.0 billion in FY 2029, or an average increase of 11 percent annually. This reflects the impact from the reduction in debt outstanding due to large prepayments over the past four years and the $1.3 billion State service contract with GDC.

## $^{ }$Debt Issuances

Debt issuances totaling $7.5 billion are planned to finance capital project spending in FY 2025, an increase of $2.2 billion (43 percent) from FY 2024. The year over year growth is largely attributable to increased capital spending which is projected for FY 2025. Bond issuances in FY 2025 will finance capital commitments for economic development and housing ($1.6 billion), education ($1.3 billion), the environment ($683 million), health and mental hygiene ($813 million), State facilities and equipment ($429 million), and transportation ($2.6 billion).

Over the five-year Capital Plan, new debt issuances are projected to total $46.3 billion. This reflects the application of $10 billion of PAYGO to supplant bond issuances, including $1 billion added in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget Financial Plan. New issuances are expected for economic development and housing ($10.2 billion), education facilities ($7.8 billion), the environment ($4.2 billion), mental hygiene and health care facilities ($5.0 billion), State facilities and equipment ($2.7 billion), and transportation infrastructure ($16.4 billion).

## $^{ }$Debt Retirements

The State expects to retire $594 million of debt in FY 2025, approximately $767 million (56 percent) less than in FY 2024. The decrease in retirements is largely due to prior prepayments, which resulted in the early retirement (defeasance) of $3.0 billion of bonds that had been scheduled to retire in FY 2025. Additional retirements beyond the level projected in FY 2025 are possible through debt management actions. Debt retirements are projected to average $2.2 billion annually over the Capital Plan period.

## Debt Service

State-related debt service is projected at $3.0 billion in FY 2025, a decrease of $4.0 billion (57 percent) from FY 2024, which is affected by the prepayment of $4.7 billion in FY 2024 of future debt service costs and additional prepayments in previous fiscal years. Adjusting for prepayments, State-related debt service is projected at $6.7 billion in FY 2025, an increase of 12 percent from FY 2024. Over the five-year Capital Plan, adjusted debt service costs are expected to grow to $8.7 billion in FY 2029, an average annual increase of 6.6 percent.

## $^{ }$Debt Affordability Measures

The State's debt affordability continues to improve as evidenced by the following measures:

 AA+ rating from all four rating agencies, the second highest credit rating.

 State debt outstanding has remained flat for the past ten years, which compares favorably to the prior ten-year growth rate in debt outstanding of 1.6 percent.

 State-related debt as a percentage of personal income has steadily declined to 3.5 percent in FY 2024, the lowest level in over 60 years and well below the historic average of 5.1 percent.

 State-related debt service, adjusting for prepayments, has averaged $6.1 billion annually over the past ten years. In FY 2024, the State paid $6.0 billion for debt service costs, or 2.6 percent of All Funds Receipts.


<!-- image -->

 From 2005 to the present, the State has not borrowed to fund a deficit, despite enduring two severe economic contractions (the Great Recession and the pandemic). This is the longest stretch without deficit borrowing since 1939 - 1972.

Future projections of debt affordability measures from FY 2025 through FY 2029 reflect a growth in bond issuances commensurate with increased capital spending estimates. If capital spending is lower than expected, debt outstanding and debt service estimates would also be lower.

 State-supported debt outstanding is projected to remain under the statutory debt cap over the Capital Plan period, declining to an estimated low point of $800 million in remaining debt capacity in FY 2029. Debt cap calculations exclude all issuances from FY 2021 and FY 2022.

 Adjusted State-related debt service as a share of All Funds Receipts is projected to increase from 2.6 percent in FY 2024 to 3.5 percent in FY 2029. Debt service is adjusted for prepayments to reflect when payments are contractually due.

 State-related debt outstanding as a percentage of personal income is expected to increase from 3.5 percent in FY 2024 to 4.8 percent in FY 2029. This includes the RRIF Loan to fund the State's contribution to the Hudson Tunnel Project.

## Debt Reform Act Limit

The Debt Reform Act of 2000 ("Debt Reform Act") restricts the issuance of State-supported debt funding to capital purposes only and, with certain limited exceptions for long-lived MTA projects, generally limits the maximum term of bonds to 30 years. The Debt Reform Act limits the amount of new State-supported debt to 4 percent of State personal income, and new State-supported debt service costs to 5 percent of All Funds receipts. The restrictions apply to State-supported debt issued after April 1, 2000. DOB, as administrator of the Debt Reform Act, determined that the State complied with the statutory caps in the most recent calculation period (FY 2023).

The State enacted legislation that suspended certain provisions of the Debt Reform Act for FY 2021 and FY 2022 bond issuances as part of the State's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, State-supported debt issued in FY 2021 and FY 2022 was not limited to capital purposes and is not counted towards the statutory caps on debt outstanding and debt service.

Current projections anticipate that State-supported debt outstanding and State-supported debt service will continue to remain below the limits imposed by the Debt Reform Act. Based on the most recent personal income and debt outstanding forecasts, the available debt capacity under the debt outstanding cap is expected to decline from $25.9 billion in FY 2024 to a low point of $800 million in FY 2029. This calculation includes the estimated impact of funding capital commitments with State bonds. The debt service on State-supported debt subject to the statutory cap is projected at $3.8 billion in FY 2025 inclusive of prior year prepayments, or roughly $8.0 billion below the statutory debt service limit.

$^{1}$ Does not include debt issued prior to April 1, 2000. Does not include debt issued in FY 2021 and FY 2022 because the debt caps were temporarily suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, pursuant to Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2020 and Chapter 59 of the Laws of 2021.

$^{2}$ Total State-supported debt service is adjusted for prepayments.


<!-- image -->

The State uses personal income estimates published by the Federal government, specifically the BEA, to calculate the cap on debt outstanding, as required by statute. The BEA revises these estimates on a quarterly basis and such revisions can be significant. For Federal reporting purposes, BEA reassigns income from the state where it was earned to the state in which a person resides, for situations where a person lives and earns income in different states (the "residency adjustment"). The BEA residency adjustment has the effect of reducing reported New York State personal income because income earned in New York by non-residents regularly exceeds income earned in other states by New York residents. The State taxes all personal income earned in New York, regardless of place of residency.

## $^{ }$Enacted Budget - Debt Cap Changes

In the FY 2025 Enacted Budget, the State includes new bond-financed capital commitments that add $1.2 billion in new debt over the five-year Capital Plan period. The capital spending increases are offset by the FY 2025 Enacted Budget personal income forecast, greater underspending on capital projects than previously assumed, changes in the timing of bond issuances, $1 billion of new PAYGO capital spending, and reductions in debt as a result of legal defeasances to date. The State may adjust capital spending priorities and debt financing practices from time to time to preserve available debt capacity and stay within the statutory limits, as events warrant.

## FY 2025 Capital Projects Spending

## $^{ }$State Capital Spending

State capital spending is authorized from appropriations made in the State budget and funded with State Authority Bonds, General Obligation Bonds, PAYGO resources, and/or Federal grants. The State Capital Plan balances the need to preserve the State's assets, invest in new initiatives, and maintain a plan that is affordable. The Capital Plan limits debt issuances to a level that is expected to allow the State to remain in compliance with its statutorily imposed debt limits and maintains sufficient capital spending for core capital projects. The Capital Plan continues investments in transportation and transit infrastructure, affordable and homeless housing, economic development, environmental protection and infrastructure, and health care.

Spending on capital projects is projected to total $17.7 billion in FY 2025. Overall, capital spending in FY 2025 is projected to increase by $2.9 billion or 20 percent from FY 2024.

## Annual Capital Spending Disbursements and Debt Impacts

The following sections summarize total capital spending from new and existing appropriations included in the Capital Plan and the related impact on State debt.

FY 2025 Capital Spending by Function $17,654 (millions of dollars)
<!-- image -->

## CAPITAL PROGRAM AND FINANCING PLAN

In FY 2025, transportation and transit spending is projected to total $7.5 billion, which represents 43 percent of total capital spending. Economic development spending accounts for 13 percent, higher education spending accounts for 11 percent, and spending related to parks and the environment represents 12 percent. The remaining 21 percent comprises spending for health care, mental hygiene, social welfare, public protection, education, general government, and the all other category, which includes Special Infrastructure Account spending.

Overall transportation and transit spending is projected to increase by $1.4 billion (22 percent) from FY 2024 to FY 2025. The growth is attributable to projected increased spending by DOT for the continuation of major road and bridge projects as well as the continuation of the State's $3.1 billion contribution to the MTA's 2020-24 Capital Plan.

Parks and environment spending is estimated to increase by $377 million (22 percent) in FY 2025, primarily reflecting the continued phase-in of the $5.5 billion clean water drinking grants program, increased capital support for State parks, NY SWIMS, and spending from the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Bond Act.

Economic development spending is projected to increase by $1.2 billion (108 percent) in FY 2025. This reflects new investments, such as the Empire AI Consortium, and ON-RAMP. The spending increase includes continued spending for the EmPower Plus New York Funding program, the State's offshore wind port infrastructure and supply chain, and ConnectALL broadband expansion. The plan also continues to invest in programs created to promote regional economic development, including spending from the Buffalo Billion program, the URI, the DRI and NY Forward, Lake Ontario REDI, and REDCs.

Spending for health care is projected to increase by $140 million (21 percent) in FY 2025. The increase is due to spending from Health Care Restructuring Program grant awards and spending related to five rounds of the Health Care Facility Transformation Program.

Spending for social welfare is projected to increase by $382 million (34 percent) in FY 2025, primarily reflecting ongoing spending from the prior housing plan and the phase-in of funding from the $25 billion housing plan, of which the State is providing $5.7 billion in direct capital assistance.

Education spending is projected to increase by $248 million (62 percent) in FY 2025. The increase is largely due to continued spending from the Smart Schools Bond Act, health and safety projects in nonpublic schools, and improvements at State-owned schools, including Native American schools and the schools for the blind and the deaf.

Higher education spending is projected to increase by $452 million (30 percent) in FY 2025, which is primarily related to maintaining SUNY and CUNY campus facilities in a state of good repair and making strategic investments in new facilities.

Spending for public protection is projected to increase by $8 million (1 percent) in FY 2025. Public protection capital funding supports maintaining DOCCS, DHSES, DMNA, and DSP infrastructure. In addition, FY 2025 continues spending for capital investments in communities with high gun violence and another round of the SCAHC grant program.

## CAPITAL PROGRAM AND FINANCING PLAN

Mental hygiene capital spending is anticipated to increase by $195 million (32 percent) in FY 2025, reflecting continued investment in mental health facilities.

General governmental capital spending is projected to increase by $243 million (68 percent) in FY 2025, which includes the maintenance of State facilities and State information technology projects.

Spending in the All Other category is projected to decrease by $1.7 billion (456 percent). Total planned capital disbursements are reduced by $2 billion, or approximately 10 percent, in each year of the Capital Plan, consistent with spending trends for the past ten years.

## Financing FY 2025 Capital Projects Spending

FY 2025 Capital Spending by Financing Source $17,654 (millions of dollars)


<!-- image -->

In FY 2025, the State plans to finance 37 percent of capital projects spending with long-term bonds and 63 percent with cash and Federal aid. Most of the long-term bonds (93 percent) will be issued on behalf of the State through public authorities. All authority debt issued on behalf of the State is approved by the State legislature, acting on behalf of the people, and the issuing authority's board of directors, and in most instances, is subject to approval by the PACB. Authority Bonds, as defined in the Capital Plan, do not include debt issued by authorities that are backed by non-State resources. State cash resources will finance 44 percent of capital spending. Federal aid is expected to fund 19 percent of the State's FY 2025 capital spending, primarily for transportation. Year-toyear, total PAYGO support is projected to increase from FY 2024 to FY 2025 by $2.3 billion, with State PAYGO increasing by $1.8 billion and Federal PAYGO support increasing by $498 million. Bond-financed spending is projected to increase by $597 million, with Authority Bond spending increasing by $736 million and General Obligation Bond spending decreasing by $140 million.

## FY 2025 Debt Issuances

Debt issuances will finance capital investments in transportation, higher education, environmental protection, economic development, and the maintenance of correctional and mental hygiene facilities. Debt issuances over the five-year period are expected to be offset by the $10 billion increase in PAYGO capital spending reflected in the last three Enacted Budgets, including $1 billion of new PAYGO resources added in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget.

The State expects to issue $7.5 billion in debt during FY 2025 to finance existing and newly authorized capital program initiatives. Economic development and transportation projects are projected to represent approximately 57 percent of new issuances. The remaining balance is divided among education, environmental facilities, health care and mental hygiene facilities, and State facilities. The State uses three credits - PIT Revenue Bonds, Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, and General Obligation Bonds - to finance capital projects.

The State plans to sell at least 50 percent of bonds on a competitive basis in FY 2025, market conditions permitting. Issuing bonds on a competitive basis (a) lowers borrowing costs, (b) provides an essential benchmark for bonds sold on a negotiated basis, and (c) increases transparency related to the bond sale process. The State issued $8.2 billion in FY 2024, with 26 percent being issued on a competitive basis. These sales provided consistently low interest costs compared to negotiated bond sales, as well as lower issuance costs.

The $7.5 billion of new issuances are expected to be sold through multiple bond sales scheduled for FY 2025 including, $5.3 billion of PIT Revenue Bonds, $1.8 billion of Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, and $458 million of General Obligation Bonds.

## FY 2025 Debt Retirements

Retirements represent the annual repayment of principal for State-related debt. Retirements are recorded as of the date payment is due to bondholders, rather than the actual date the State makes the cash payment. For example, if principal payments are due on April 1, the bonds are considered outstanding on March 31, even if the State is contractually obligated to make payments to the bond trustee prior to that date.

The rate at which State-related debt is retired or paid off has an impact on the State's ability to recycle debt capacity to finance new capital projects. Relatively faster amortization frees up debt capacity but increases debt service costs in the State operating budget. Over time the practice of retiring debt more quickly increases the State's debt service burden at the expense of other purposes.


| Period   | Cumulative Percentage of Existing Debt to  be Retired 1   |

Over the next five years, retirements of State-related debt are projected to average $2.2 billion annually. Retirements projected in FY 2025 of $594 million are substantially below the annual average due to the early retirement of bonds as part of debt prepayments. The following pie charts provide a distribution of projected debt retirements for FY 2025 by both functional area and financing program.

## FY 2025 Debt Outstanding

State-related debt outstanding is projected to increase from $54.3 billion in FY 2024 to $62.5 billion in FY 2025. Debt issuances during FY 2025 are expected to add about $5.2 billion in new debt, while $594 million of State-related debt is expected to be retired during FY 2025. In addition, the State is expected to finalize a service contract (i.e., financing agreement) with GDC to cover the costs related to the Hudson Tunnel Project, which adds $1.3 billion of new debt obligations in FY 2025. Projected State-related debt outstanding at the end of FY 2025 is summarized by major programmatic area and credit below.

## FY 2025 Debt Service

State-related debt service is projected to total $3.0 billion in FY 2025. The State's debt service costs consist of payments to meet obligations for bonds issued over the past 30 years, as well as new debt service costs that will result from bond issuances projected to occur during the forecast period. Debt service payments due on existing debt total approximately $2.9 billion. The remaining FY 2025 payments are for new money debt issued in FY 2025 ($129 million). State-related debt service costs also include service contract payments to GDC related to the Hudson Tunnel Project ($3 million). These debt service payments reflect the amount that is expected to be paid in FY 2025 and are not adjusted for prepayments.

Bond-financed capital investments, primarily for transportation, education, and economic development account for most of the State's debt service costs. The majority of debt service costs are for bonds approved by the Legislature, on behalf of the people, and issued on the State's behalf by public authorities. As the State issues bonds under the PIT and Sales Tax credit structures, debt service for service contract bonds will decline, while PIT and Sales Tax Revenue Bond debt service will increase.

The following charts summarize debt service costs by both program area and financing program.

## Transportation and Transit

The Capital Plan further expands the State's investments in transportation and mass transit infrastructure. The FY 2025 Enacted Budget includes funding support for both the DOT and the MTA Capital Plans. Both are increases over previous plans and will continue to improve the State's transportation and transit systems.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget reflects the third year of a $33 billion, five-year DOT Capital Plan that will improve the State's roads, bridges, airports, rail facilities, ports, and other transit systems. The DOT Capital Plan provides almost $7.7 billion in FY 2025 and includes funding from both State and Federal resources.

For FY 2025, the Capital Plan includes $638 million for the CHIPS and Marchiselli local highway and bridge programs; $100 million for Extreme Winter Recovery; $140 million for State Touring Routes; $45 million for freight and passenger rail; and $27 million for aviation. The Capital Plan also commits $150 million in local highway aid through the PAVE NY program and includes an additional $200 million to fund Pave Our Potholes, a State and local program that commits $1 billion over the five-year plan. The Capital Plan also includes $200 million to fund local bridge projects from the BRIDGE NY program as part of a $1 billion total commitment over the five-year plan.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget also includes $18 million to fund the bus terminal expansion to the Louise M. Slaughter Intermodal Station in Rochester.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget includes $166 million of capital assistance appropriations for nonMTA transit. This total includes the fifth $20 million installment of a five-year, $100 million program to assist local transit systems with the transition to electric buses, and $26 million for the NFTA's existing rail system. These are part of a five-year, $724 million investment in non-MTA transit services that began in FY 2023.

The MTA's $52.1 billion 2020-2024 Capital Program represents the largest investment in MTA infrastructure in State history. The program prioritizes improvements to signal technology, increases accessibility, addresses quality of life concerns, invests in the LIRR and Metro North Railroad, and upgrades bus service. To accompany this investment, the State enacted key reforms and dedicated funding streams for the MTA. The State secured $25 billion in financing to directly support the MTA's 2020-2024 Capital Program, consisting of $15 billion from the Central Business District Tolling Program and $10 billion from other tax sources.

In addition, the Enacted Budget continues the State's $3.1 billion contribution to the MTA's 20202024 Capital Program. The program will increase accessibility by making 70 additional subway stations ADA-accessible so that stations serving over 60 percent of passengers will be fully accessible.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget also includes funding for future MTA capital projects, including: $52 million to advance design and engineering for the Interborough Express; $16 million for a feasibility study, environmental review, and preliminary engineering for the potential westward expansion of the Second Avenue Subway; and $20 million to advance a study, environmental review, and preliminary construction work to improve resiliency on the Metro North Hudson River Line.

In addition, the FY 2025 Enacted Budget includes $69 million in funding to cover the New York State share of costs related to the Hudson Yards Concrete Casing-Section 3 portion of the Gateway Program.

In addition to investments in new rolling stock (i.e., subway cars, train cars, and buses), the MTA Capital Program advances several major construction projects. These include Phase 2 of the Second Avenue subway project, which will provide three new fully ADA compliant stations and a connection with the Metro North Railroad. The Penn Station Access project will carry New Haven line passengers and East Bronx passengers directly into Penn Station. The East Side Access project has brought the LIRR into Grand Central Madison, a new concourse below Grand Central Terminal. The program also completes funding for the LIRR third track project, which adds 10 miles of mainline between Floral Park and Hicksville, providing additional capacity and shortened service disruptions for 41 percent of LIRR ridership .

## Parks and Environment

Over the course of the Capital Plan, environment and parks capital spending will continue to support climate change mitigation efforts; conservation of environmental resources; clean water and wastewater infrastructure needs; on-going improvements to parks and public lands; and the continued cleanup of environmentally hazardous areas, in addition to many other capital and infrastructure needs throughout the State.

The Capital Plan includes $400 million in funding for the EPF for FY 2025. Annual spending from the EPF is projected to increase to $380 million in FY 2025, while averaging $398 million per year thereafter. The EPF finances a variety of environmental projects and is funded through several revenue sources including RETT, unredeemed deposits on cans, bottles and containers, and a transfer from the General Fund. Additional miscellaneous environmental receipts to the EPF include wetland permit applications, pesticide applications, and water withdrawal fees; freshwater wetland, mineral resource, hazardous waste, and electronic waste fees; and interest from the sale and lease of surplus property.

The Capital Plan includes $100 million in new funding for the State Superfund Program and advances $500 million for clean water infrastructure funding, which continues the State's commitment to the development of clean drinking water and wastewater infrastructure, as well as source water protection.

Also included is a new round of appropriations under the NYW program, which will provide $90 million to DEC for flood control, air monitoring infrastructure, the improvement of various campgrounds, the repair and maintenance of dams, stewardship of public lands, and the rehabilitation of fish hatcheries. The Enacted Budget will also provide $200 million to support OPRHP's capital projects budget, $150 million for the NY SWIMS initiative, and $100 million for projects corresponding to the 100 th anniversary of New York State park system.

DEC's capital spending is expected to average $1.8 billion annually to meet health and safety requirements; ensure compliance with state and federal environmental mandates; maintain and upgrade campgrounds, environmental centers and camps, fish hatcheries, and other State-owned facilities; maintain flood control structures; fund wastewater and drinking water infrastructure; and fund shore protection projects for communities threatened by coastal erosion.

The Capital Plan also includes a new $50 million appropriation to support the implementation of Executive Order 22. Investments will be made to supplement public facilities' decarbonization efforts and provide resources to initiate procurement practices that prioritize sustainable and climate-resilient design practices.

## Economic Development

Economic development spending will support capital projects and programs intended to create jobs, increase economic activity, and retain and attract businesses to the State.

The Capital Plan includes over $2.3 billion in new appropriations for regional economic development initiatives. The new funding provides: $150 million for competitively determined economic development projects through the REDC; $400 million for the NYW EDF; $82.5 million for ORDA; $100 million for NY Forward; $100 million for the eighth round of DRI; $8 million for Market New York projects; $250 million for Empire AI Consortium; $110 million for the ON-RAMP; $500 million for NY CREATES; $250 million for the redevelopment of State-owned sites for housing; $50 million for the Restore NY Communities Initiative; and $309 million for other regional capital projects.

The Capital Plan maintains over $9.9 billion in reappropriated capital funding for various economic development and regional initiatives, including: URI; Transformative Investment; REDC and high technology initiatives; grants for communities affected by correctional and youth facility closures; statewide competitive grant programs; specific downstate regional initiatives; and upstate city-bycity projects. Funding is also included for cultural facilities, university development, and environmental and energy projects.

## Health

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget establishes a new Safety Net Transformation Plan, which will be authorized to utilize existing resources from the existing Statewide Health Care Facility Transformation Programs (Statewide) IV and Statewide V programs to support capital improvements and provide regulatory flexibility for Safety Net Hospitals and their partners. Additionally, the FY 2025 Enacted Budget authorizes up to $20 million from existing Statewide V resources to support capital grants to institutions and facilities that carry out the research and treatment of ALS and other rare diseases, including the Empire State ALS Alliance. This funding will be used to enable further innovation, research, and drug development, and to provide funding for health care providers involved in the treatment with these diseases to carry out transformative capital improvements. The Enacted Budget also authorizes up to $300 million from existing Statewide V resources to support a transformation plan at State University Of New York Hospital at Brooklyn and/or the State University Health Science Center at Brooklyn.

The Capital Plan also includes projected grant disbursements from the existing $1.2 billion Capital Restructuring Financing program as well as Statewide Health Care Facility Transformation programs ($3.8 billion) and Kings County Transformation ($700 million).

The Capital Plan continues $355 million in additional health care capital funding re-appropriated from the SIA to support health care facility transformations. This builds on $1.6 billion in HEAL NY grants, which started in FY 2006. Including FY 2025 investments, health care providers will have received $9.5 billion in capital support over the last seventeen years.

The Capital Plan continues to provide support for the SHIN-NY and APD programs, as well as other health care IT initiatives. This includes supplemental investments of $2.5 million in FY 2025 to support the SHIN-NY expansion. Additionally, the capital program supports maintenance and improvements of laboratories and institutions operated by DOH, and the Federal Safe Drinking Water Program. This includes an investment of $1.7 billion to reconstruct the Wadsworth Centers for Laboratories and Research, which is expected to break ground during FY 2025. The Capital Plan also continues $2 million in annual funding to support laboratory testing of drinking water in underserved and rural communities to combat emerging contaminants, otherwise known as "forever chemicals".

In addition to the ongoing $51.3 million in maintenance support provided to RPCI on an annual basis, the Capital Plan includes an investment of $4 million for RPCI to expand their existing mobile cancer screening efforts in western NY and establish mobile screening units specializing in breast and lung cancer. RPCI projects that the introduction of this unit will increase advanced screening in positive cases of breast cancer from 80% to 90% and from 37% to 60% for prostate cancer in these populations. It is also anticipated that the expansion of mobile screening efforts will reduce mortality from these cancers by 26 cases per year in Erie and Niagara Counties.

## Health (Continued)

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget also proposes a new $10 million investment under DOH for the purposes of providing safety and security grants for at risk reproductive health centers. This initiative would seek to build upon previous investments to combat anti-abortion violence and harassment, and ensure the continued ability of reproductive health centers to provide these services.

Overall, spending for health care capital is projected to increase by approximately $140 million from FY 2024 to FY 2025. This increase is primarily due to the new investments in RPCI mobile cancer screening and Safety and Security Grants for reproductive health providers, as well as an increase in disbursements related to the Statewide IV and V programs and WCLR reconstruction initiative.

## Social Welfare

Capital spending for social welfare supports HHAP grants administered by OTDA, the preservation and maintenance of youth facilities operated by OCFS, and programs administered by HCR to create and preserve affordable housing units across the State.

The Capital Plan continues the multi-year $25 billion investment to create and preserve 100,000 affordable homes, including 10,000 homes with supportive services for vulnerable populations, and to electrify an additional 50,000 homes. The Capital Plan also includes funding to support capital improvements at OCFS Youth Facilities.

## Education

Education capital spending includes the costs of the Smart Schools General Obligation Bond Act, funding for the SED capital plan, and the EXCEL program.

Current estimates in the Capital Plan project that the State will spend approximately $1.7 billion over the upcoming five-year period for SED's capital projects. This projection includes: $898 million for the Smart Schools Bond Act; $309 million for nonpublic school health and safety projects, including maintenance of nonpublic schools' facilities; $122 million for public library construction projects; $78 million for health and safety projects at the State-supported schools for the blind and deaf; $68 million for renovation projects at State-owned schools on Native American reservations; $59 million for the Cultural Education Storage Facility; $38 million for infrastructure improvements and minor rehabilitation projects at the Rome School for the Deaf, Batavia School for the Blind, the Cultural Education Center, and the Education Building; $35 million for the development of a State aid data system; $26 million for safety and security upgrades at nonpublic schools, day cares, community centers, and residential and day camps; $24 million for the ongoing development of an electronic licensing system for the Office of the Professions; $21 million for other projects, including the New York State Museum Gallery Renewal and the State Longitudinal Data System; $21 million to support personal service and other costs associated with staff whose duties include the maintenance, preservation, and operation of SED facilities; $17 million for Smart Schools nonpublic school projects; $13 million for EXCEL; and $10 million for renovation projects at the New York State Museum, Library, and Archives.

The FY 2025 Capital Plan expands SED's capital budget by providing $189 million in new capital appropriations to support: nonpublic school health and safety projects, including repair and maintenance of nonpublic schools' facilities ($70 million); construction projects at public libraries ($44 million); health and safety projects at the State-supported schools for the blind and deaf ($30 million); rehabilitation and renovation projects at State-owned schools on Native American reservations ($20 million); renovation projects at the New York State Museum, Library, and Archives ($10 million); rehabilitation and renovation projects at the School for the Blind and the School for the Deaf ($7 million); maintenance projects at SED's other State-owned facilities ($3 million); and personal service and other costs associated with staff whose duties include the maintenance, preservation, and operation of SED facilities ($4 million).

Overall spending for education capital projects is projected to increase by $248 million in FY 2025. The increase is largely due to continued spending from the Smart Schools Bond Act, the implementation of additional programs included in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget, and implementation delays in prior year initiatives.

## Higher Education

Higher education capital spending includes the costs of the SUNY and CUNY capital plans as well as funding for private colleges and universities through the HECap Program.

The Capital Plan provides SUNY and CUNY with $7.2 billion in new appropriations over the fiveyear period. New capital funding will allow the university systems to maintain existing capital infrastructure, as well as advance new capital investments.

The five-year plan includes $4.5 billion to support infrastructure improvements at SUNY Stateoperated campuses and CUNY senior colleges ($2.9 billion for SUNY and $1.6 billion for CUNY) and $574 million to match local sponsor funding for community college capital projects. Other expenses in the five-year plan include: $1.1 billion for SUNY maintenance and operations positions; $375 million for SUNY residence hall projects funded with dorm fees; $378 million for CUCF, DASNY, and SUCF operations; $150 million for capital projects at SUNY hospitals funded with hospital revenue; $100 million for SUNY campus-funded projects; and $40 million for HECap grants to private colleges.

For FY 2025, the Enacted Budget provides $1.5 billion in new bonded spending authority, which includes: $710 million for SUNY State-operated campuses, $424 million for CUNY senior colleges, $154 million ($138 million for SUNY and $16 million for CUNY) to support capital projects at community colleges, $150 million for SUNY hospitals, and $40 million for HECap grants.

The Capital Plan assumes $1.9 billion in FY 2025 disbursements for higher education capital expenses. Of this amount, SUNY is projected to spend $1.4 billion, which includes: $910 million for the State-operated campuses and hospitals; $86 million for community colleges; $75 million for educational facility projects supported by non-State funds (i.e., grants and donations); $100 million for dormitory-related projects; $29 million for the SUCF; and $210 million for staff whose job duties include the maintenance, preservation, and operation of facilities. CUNY is projected to spend $506 million in FY 2025 for capital projects, including $465 million for senior colleges and community colleges, as well as $41 million for operating costs supported by the General Fund. Additionally, the HECap Program is expected to disburse $34 million during FY 2025 in support of private college and university projects.

Overall spending for higher education capital projects is projected to increase by $452 million from FY 2024 to FY 2025.

## Mental Hygiene

The Capital Plan continues to fund projects to preserve and maintain institutional and communitybased facilities operated and/or licensed by OMH, OPWDD, and OASAS.

The Capital Plan provides resources to renovate and maintain community-based residential and non-residential services, and State-operated inpatient and residential services. Specifically, the Capital Plan supports projects for OPWDD's residential and day programs to meet safety standards, and the development of new community-based settings.

## General Government

General government capital spending in FY 2025 includes: construction, rehabilitation, consolidation, and renovation of State office buildings to maintain asset value, achieve space efficiencies, and reduce operational costs; an ongoing commitment to sustainability through the procurement of zero-emission light duty vehicles; systems modernization projects to enhance agency workflow and accessibility; and IT systems modernization and improvement efforts designed to implement enterprise solutions that enhance service delivery.

Spending for OGS will continue to support State facilities capital projects. The FY 2025 Enacted Budget continues to invest funding in State government facility infrastructure projects including:

 Various ESP infrastructure projects to address natural deterioration that causes recurring mechanical failures, structural vulnerabilities, and power outages;

 Renovation of the State Capitol roof and courtyard;

 Recurring maintenance funding to address projects across the State; and

 Repair and rehabilitation of the Shirley Chisholm State Office Building in Brooklyn.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget also provides funding for the ongoing electrification of the State fleet by 2035. This annual funding is estimated to grow as the percentage of zero-emission vehicles purchased by the State increases through 2035.

Spending for ITS will continue the State's technology consolidation and improvement efforts, as prioritized through the IT governance process.

The FY 2025 Enacted Budget includes $15 million to support the purchase of new electronic poll books for local Boards of Elections.

## All Other

Spending for agencies in the All Other category supports capital investments for the SIA; SAM, CREST, and LOCAP grant programs; statewide equipment, systems development and upgrades; the Arts and Cultural Facilities program; Lake Ontario REDI program; and capital projects for the Judiciary, the Department of Law (Attorney General), and OSC. Additionally, All Other spending includes a spending adjustment to accommodate potential under-spending projected to occur as a result of normal timing related to the delivery of capital projects as well as the implementation of capital efficiency plans at State agencies and authorities.

## State and Municipal Facilities

The Capital Plan retains $1.9 billion in reappropriations for the State and Municipal Facilities Program. Entities eligible to receive grants under this program include: State agencies, local governments (e.g., counties, cities, towns, and villages), MTA, SUNY and CUNY senior and community colleges, private nonprofit colleges and universities, public school districts, public housing authorities, public libraries, fire districts, and other entities.

Similar to other State funded grant programs, non-State entities receiving funds through the State and Municipal Facilities Program must be qualified for eligibility through the NYS Grants Gateway, which includes a vetting process to determine organizational integrity, capacity to administer grants, and legal compliance. Additionally, the program administrator (DASNY) performs an independent review and certification process to assess a potential grantee's: (i) grant history, (ii) institutional and employee integrity, (iii) compliance with all NYS laws and regulations, and (iv) fiscal responsibility and resources.

## Community Resiliency, Economic Sustainability, and Technology Program

The Capital Plan includes $769 million in reappropriations for the Community Resiliency, Economic Sustainability, and Technology Program. Grants under this program will be awarded to qualifying capital projects at civic facilities that support arts, cultural, athletic, housing, child care, educational, parks and recreational, transportation, port development, economic development, workforce training, employment development, tourism, community redevelopment, climate change mitigation, resiliency, environmental sustainability, and other civic activities. Additionally, the FY25 Enacted budget includes $385 million in new funding.

## Local Community Assistance Program

The Capital Plan retains $184 million in reappropriations for the Local Community Assistance Program. Grants under this program will be awarded to municipal and state governmental entities, public authorities, and not-for-profit corporations for eligible capital expenses related to community development or redevelopment, revitalization, economic development, economic sustainability, arts and cultural development, housing, public security and safety and local infrastructure improvement or enhancement.

## State Equipment

The Capital Plan retains $534 million in reappropriations for the Statewide Equipment financing program. In addition, the Capital Plan includes a new $100 million appropriation to acquire and modernize State equipment. This centralized approach to equipment acquisition allows the State to allocate capital funding based on an enterprise-wide assessment of agency needs. Equipment purchases may include the acquisition and/or modernization of information systems, health and safety equipment, heavy equipment and machinery, security systems, and laboratory equipment.

## Arts and Cultural Facilities

The Capital Plan provides $80 million in new appropriation authority and retains $82 million in reappropriations to support capital grants to nonprofit arts and cultural organizations. These programs focus on improving the quality, efficiency, and accessibility of arts and cultural organizations.

## Lake Ontario REDI

The Capital Plan retains $17 million in reappropriations to support the 2019 REDI program, which was created in response to the extended pattern of flooding along the shores of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River. REDI and the Lake Ontario Business Resiliency Program intends to address the immediate and long-term resiliency needs of these areas while also enhancing economic development opportunities and the health of the lake.

## Special Infrastructure Account

The SIA will continue to support a wide range of projects throughout the State. The Capital Plan retains $2.0 billion in capital reappropriations, including a $1.2 billion reappropriation for the Pennsylvania Station Area Civic and Land Use Improvement Project.

## Financing Sources of Capital Projects Spending

The State issues bonds (both directly and through public authorities) and uses Federal and State PAYGO resources to finance capital spending. All bonds issued through public authorities on behalf of the State are approved by the Legislature, on behalf of the people. Since 1976, all Staterelated debt, except General Obligation Bonds, has been subject to more rigorous approval processes, including PACB and authority boards. The amounts for All Governmental Funds spending include both those capital project disbursements that are reflected in the Comptroller's accounting system, and those disbursements which would have formerly been made directly from bond proceeds which had been reflected only in GAAP accounting statements. Over the plan, 52 percent of capital spending is projected to be financed with authority-issued bonds and General Obligation Bonds, and 48 percent is projected to be financed with State and Federal PAYGO resources.

## $^{ }$Authority Bond Financing

The State's PIT Revenue Bonds and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds, the State's principal vehicles for financing capital projects, are currently issued by three public authorities, DASNY, ESD and NYSTA, on behalf of the State. Other State-supported bonds, excluding General Obligation Bonds, have been issued by public authorities in prior years.

Authority bond-financed capital spending is reimbursed from the proceeds of bonds sold by State public authorities pursuant to contractual agreements with the State. Reimbursements are managed to maximize efficient financing of capital projects from State resources. Factors affecting the timing of reimbursement of State expenditures include the availability of existing bond proceeds, bond market access, investment terms, and State cash flow considerations.

Over the Capital Plan period, approximately 49 percent of total spending will be financed with authority bond proceeds. The State expects to use State PIT and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds as the financing vehicles for the vast majority of bond-financed spending.

 State PIT and Sales Tax Revenue Bonds will be issued for the following purposes:

o Economic Development and Housing. Housing, REDCs, and other regional economic development initiatives (FY 2025 issuances of $1.6 billion).

o Education. SUNY and CUNY, EXCEL, SED, and HECap (FY 2025 issuances of $1.3 billion).

o Environment. Clean Water Infrastructure Act, State Revolving Fund, State Superfund Program, EPF, State Parks, and other environmental projects (FY 2025 issuances of $683 million).

o Health Care. Health Care Facilities Transformation Program, as well as capital projects to preserve and maintain both State and community-based facilities operated and/or licensed by OMH, OPWDD, and OASAS (FY 2025 issuances of $813 billion).

o State Facilities and Equipment. Correctional facilities, youth facilities, State office buildings, OCFS, DHSES, and State Police capital (FY 2025 issuances of $429 million).

## General Obligation Bond Financing

The State finances a portion of its capital projects with General Obligation Bonds. Over the Plan period, the State expects that $1.9 billion of General Obligation Bonds will be issued to fund projects authorized pursuant to the Smart Schools Bond Act, Rebuild and Renew New York Transportation Bond Act of 2005 and other transportation purposes, and the Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act of 2022 and other environmental bond acts.

General Obligation Bonds must be approved directly by the voters at a general election. Only one General Obligation offering, limited to a single work or purpose, may be voted on in a general election. General Obligation bond-financed spending accounts for approximately 2 percent of total spending over the Capital Plan. The Capital Plan assumes the continued implementation of ten previously authorized bond acts (five for transportation, four for environmental and recreational programs, and one for education), as well as spending for the $4.2 billion Clean Water, Clean Air, and Green Jobs Bond Act that was approved by voters in November 2022.

## $^{ }$State and Federal PAYGO Sources and Uses

State PAYGO resources include: taxes collected in the General Fund; other taxes and user fees set aside or dedicated for specific capital programs; repayments from local governments and public authorities for their share of projects; and transfers from other funds, including monetary settlements from the General Fund. Over the five-year Plan, State PAYGO resources are expected to support 29 percent of total spending. Federal PAYGO resources support spending financed by grants from the Federal Government, primarily for highways and bridges, drinking water and water pollution control facilities, public protection, and housing, and constitute 20 percent of total spending over the Capital Plan.

The DHBTF receives revenue from motor vehicle fees, the petroleum business tax, the motor fuel tax, the highway use tax, the auto rental tax, utilities taxes, and miscellaneous transportationrelated fees. Receipts deposited into the DHBTF are used to pay debt service on transportation bonds, finance capital projects on a PAYGO basis, and pay certain operating expenses of transportation agencies. A detailed accounting of the sources and uses of the DHBTF can be found in the "Detailed Data" section of the Capital Plan.


<!-- image -->

Capital spending supported by General Fund receipts is funded with a transfer to various capital projects funds. The General Fund is projected to transfer, on average, $3.1 billion annually over the Capital Plan period to finance capital spending on projects administered by DOT, OGS, HCR, DEC, OPRHP, DOCCS, the Department of Mental Hygiene, and other State agencies. Furthermore, the General Fund is expected to transfer an average of $276 million annually from FY 2025 to FY 2029 to the DHBTF. Capital transfers also include, on average, $341 million annually from the General Fund to the DIIF, of which $257 million is from extraordinary monetary settlements.

State PAYGO resources, derived primarily from statutorily dedicated revenues that finance projects for environmental and recreational purposes, are projected to average approximately $656 million annually. In addition to receipts that will be deposited annually into the Hazardous Waste Remedial Fund, the EPF will continue to receive annual deposits from the RETTs for a total of $1.3 billion over the Capital Plan period. In addition to RETT revenues, over the Capital Plan period, the EPF is expected to receive $115 million from unclaimed deposits from the Bottle Bill, $25 million in RGGI funds, $3 million in Waste Tire funds, and $500 million from General Fund transfers. The EPF also receives receipts from pesticide applicator fees, wetland permits, water withdrawal fees, and other miscellaneous receipts totaling approximately $20 million annually. These taxes and miscellaneous receipts will support PAYGO portions of projects advanced from the EPF.

The SPIF will finance about $87 million annually in improvements to the State's Park system from park fees and other miscellaneous revenues.

Federal grants support 20 percent of total capital spending over the Capital Plan. The largest components of Federal PAYGO spending over the Capital Plan are for transportation ($14.1 billion) and the environment ($2.2 billion). Federal PAYGO spending is projected to average $3.8 billion per year, with an average $2.8 billion annually spent on transportation.

Federal authorizations in the IIJA are expected to provide $13.6 billion in Federal funding from the IIJA, of which $5.9 billion is expected to flow through the State budget, primarily for road and bridge projects, and $7.7 billion is to be disbursed by public authorities, primarily the MTA, and local governments. In total, the State is expected to receive funding for the following programs:

 Roads, Bridges, and Major Projects ($4.8 billion);

 Public Transit ($4.1 billion);

 Clean Water, Weatherization, and Resiliency ($3.2 billion);

 Broadband Access (up to $800 million); and

 Airports ($685 million).

Additionally, the State was allocated $346 million from the Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund, which was included in the ARPA. This funding is expected to be used to support the ConnectALL initiative to provide affordable broadband access to New York residents in rural and urban areas.

Finally, the Inflation Reduction Act ("IRA," PL 117-169), which was signed into law in August 2022, makes New York (and other State's, municipalities, and tax-exempt entities and organizations) eligible to receive the value of new and extended clean energy tax credits as elective payments. This program provides funding for clean energy production and investment projects, including:

 Installation of energy facilities (e.g. biogas projects, solar);

 Conversion of vehicle fleets to electric/hybrid;

 EV charging station deployment;

 Use of renewable fuels, such as biodiesel; and

 Energy efficient building design and construction.

The State is currently reviewing projects recently placed into service, as well as future projects, for eligibility under the program to assist in meeting the State's climate goals.

## DEBT OVERVIEW


<!-- image -->

State debt levels, as measured by common benchmarks, are summarized below. All measures reflect the total level of State-related debt issued for all State purposes as described in the "Introduction" section of this Plan. In order to provide consistent comparisons, debt service has been adjusted to reflect prepayments. In addition, FY 2021 debt service excludes repayment of $4.4 billion of PIT notes which provided short-term liquidity for the State. Such adjustments and exclusions have been noted accordingly.

## $^{ }$State Debt as a Percent of Personal Income

The State debt projections from FY 2025 to FY 2029 reflect a 9.8 percent average annual increase in debt levels and 4.1 percent average annual increase in statewide personal income. As a result, debt as a percentage of personal income is expected to increase over the five-year Plan period, from 3.9 percent in FY 2025 to 4.8 percent in FY 2029.

Over a longer time horizon, State-related debt outstanding as a percentage of personal income is projected to drop from 5.0 percent in FY 2015 to 4.8 percent in FY 2029. This decline can be largely attributed to the retirement of State debt, which has accelerated over the past three years due to early retirement (defeasance) of debt due to prepayments. Over the last ten-years debt has remained virtually the same at $54.3 billion and personal income grew at 4.0 percent annually, which has resulted in debt to PI declining to 3.5 percent today.

The following table compares the State's debt as a percentage of personal income to other peer states and the U.S. average.


<!-- image -->


<!-- image -->

## State Debt Outstanding

From 2010 to 2020, State debt outstanding fell by .05%. This was the first absolute decline in debt measured over a census decade (i.e., ten-year periods starting in years ending in zero) since 1880. State debt has remained flat since 2020.


<!-- image -->

Adjusted for inflation, the State's debt level is roughly the same as it was in 1982.


<!-- image -->


<!-- image -->

## State Debt Per Capita

State-related debt per capita is projected to increase from $2,757 in FY 2015 to $4,721 in FY 2029, an average annual increase of 3.9 percent. As of FY 2024, the State's debt per capita of $2,775 is consistent with metrics from 10-years ago.


<!-- image -->

New York's debt per capita in FY 2023 of $2,841 ranked eleventh highest in the nation and fifth compared to peer states as shown in the chart below.


<!-- image -->


<!-- image -->

## Debt Service

After adjusting for debt service prepayments, debt service costs from FY 2025 through FY 2029 are projected to increase by an average of 6.6 percent annually, while All Funds receipts are projected to increase by an average of 1.7 percent through FY 2029. Thus, debt service costs are projected to be about 3.5 percent of the All Funds budget in FY 2029 due to the issuance of bonds to finance the State's capital needs.


<!-- image -->


<!-- image -->

The 0.5 percent average annual rate of growth in adjusted debt service from FY 2015 through FY 2025 is lower than the growth in inflation of 2.9 percent and the 4.7 percent growth in State revenue during that same time period.


<!-- image -->

*Adjusted for prepayments

Debt service growth after adjusting for prepayments is projected to average roughly 6.6 percent in the forecast period due to continued support for the State's capital program. If capital spends closer to historical levels, the projected growth in State debt service will be significantly less than shown below.

## DETAILED DATA

## Variable Rate Exposure and Interest Rate Exchange Agreements

Article 5-D of the State Finance Law authorizes the use of a limited amount of variable rate obligations and interest rate exchange agreements ("swaps"). The statute was implemented as a debt management tool to lower debt service costs, diversify the State's debt portfolio and to better match variable rate debt exposure to variable rate earnings on the State's short-term investments. Issuers of State-supported bonds may enter variable rate debt instruments that result in a maximum net variable rate exposure of 15 percent of State-supported debt. Issuers may also enter into interest rate exchange agreements in a total notional amount that does not exceed 15 percent of State-supported debt, subject to various criteria established in the statute to reduce risk.

## $^{ }$Variable Rate Exposure

The State's variable rate exposure is expected to average 0.1 percent of outstanding debt from FY 2025 through FY 2029. The debt that is counted against the variable rate cap represents the State's unhedged variable rate bonds. The State continues to evaluate the utilization of variable rate debt as part of the debt portfolio, but has no current plans to issue variable rate bonds.

## Interest Rate Exchange Agreements (Swaps)

In FY 2022 the State took advantage of favorable market conditions to terminate all remaining swaps outstanding. The State used this opportunity to eliminate the inherent risks associated with swaps, including basis risk, tax risk, counterparty risk, and liquidity risk. The following table shows the calculation of the State's interest rate exchange statutory cap. Currently, there are no interest rate exchange agreements outstanding, and the State is not currently considering the use of new swaps.

## Bond Caps

Bond caps provide the legal authorizations to issue bonds to finance a portion of the State's Capital Plan. Bond caps can finance a single year's appropriations or can be for multi-year periods. As the bond cap for a particular programmatic purpose is reached, subsequent legislative changes are required to raise the statutory caps to the level necessary to meet the bondable capital needs. A total of $13.7 billion of increased bond authorizations are included in the Capital Plan. The following table details the bond cap authorizations for all State-supported debt, including legislative actions included in the Capital Plan.

The Capital Plan includes $20 million in funding for a municipal consolidation competition to encourage the reduction of costs through a competitive process to be administered by DOS. This funding is in addition to $150 million for the first DRI and for municipal restructuring to assist and encourage local governments and school districts to implement shared services, cooperation agreements, mergers, and other actions that are intended to reduce operating costs and property tax burdens. The second DRI ($100 million) funds housing, economic development, transportation, and community projects to attract and retain residents, visitors, and businesses to downtowns.

## State Debt Detail

The tables that follow provide a comprehensive listing of all current and projected State debt outstanding, debt service costs, debt retirements, and new debt issuances.

State-related debt levels reported in the tables are cash-basis amounts that are consistent with the GAAP basis debt levels reported in the ACFR. Thus, the tables reflect all debt issued by the State (including blended component units) for Government activities and Business-type activities as defined in the ACFR.

The tables do not include debt that is issued by, or on behalf of, local governments that may be funded in part by State assistance and grants or aid payments. However, such debt is reflected in the respective financial statements of the local governments responsible for the issuance of such debt.

The DHBTF had a financing gap, or deficit, of $85 million in FY 2024. Gaps are projected to average $562 million in the outyears, for a total gap of $2.8 billion from FY 2025 through FY 2029. These projections are based upon estimates of revenues, bond proceeds, transfers, debt service, and program disbursements. Gap estimates are the result of an imbalance in the DHBTF between projected revenues and expenditures.

The table below provides DHBTF bond coverage ratios for prior and future periods.

## Increasing Opportunities for Minority and Women-Owned Business Enterprises and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Business Enterprises

The New York State DOT promotes the use of M/WBE and SDVOB firms through its purchasing office, construction contracts, and consultant contracts. As part of the outreach process, the Department provides all prospective vendors with educational information on how to do business with the Department. In addition, the Department holds webinars, partners with other State agencies, and sponsors regional in-person training sessions on best practices for increasing engagement with the Department.

Only M/WBEs certified by ESD are used to fulfill goals on 100-percent State-funded projects and/or goods and services. Only SDVOBs certified by the OGS SDVOB Development Office are used to fulfill goals on 100-percent State-funded projects and/or goods and services. For projects that are eligible for Federal funding, the Department is one of four agencies in the New York State Unified Certification Program that are authorized to certify businesses as DBEs, which is a Federal (USDOT) certification program. The other three certifying partners are the MTA, NFTA, and PANYNJ.

The Department establishes annual goals for M/WBE participation that support the State's 30 percent goal. Regulations require a 6 percent SDVOB participation goal for construction contracts, professional service agreements (including civil engineering), and for the procurement of goods and services. The Department reviews these goals and takes appropriate measures to help ensure attainment, including the removal of barriers to participating in NYSDOT contracts. These goals are based on projected opportunities and the availability of certified M/WBEs and SDVOB's in relation to the projected areas of opportunity. The Department submits its Annual M/WBE Goal Plan to the director of the State Division of Minority and Women Business Development. The Department submits its Annual SDVOB Goal Plan to the director of the ServiceDisabled Veteran Owned Business Development Office.

The Department partners regularly with Federal, State, and local agencies, as well as industry/professional associations and community-based organizations to conduct outreach to the M/WBE and SDVOB community regarding contract opportunities and the Department's contracting methods (i.e., lowest responsible bidder, best value, discretionary purchasing, etc.). These organizations include: The Federal Highway Administration, ESD, OGS, the Small Business Administration, PANYNJ, the Association of General Contractors, General Contracting Association, and the Association of Minority Enterprises of New York. The Office of Diversity and Opportunity has conducted, and will continue to conduct, D/M/WBE and SDVOB outreach and business networking events that focus on upcoming Department contracting opportunities in an effort to encourage and increase participation.

The Department will also continue to implement targeted supportive services to DBEs using Federal funds. Since many DBEs are also certified M/WBEs, these supportive services will benefit firms in both contracting programs. Furthermore, the Department is developing a pilot Mentor/ Protégé program as a strategy for DBEs to increase their contracting opportunities. The Governor remains committed to maximizing M/WBE and SDVOB participation in State contracting and continues to set a 30 percent M/WBE utilization goal and 6 percent SDVOB utilization goal. The Department remains committed to expanding and maximizing opportunities for M/WBE and SDVOB firms and continues to endeavor to meet the goals through increased M/WBE and SDVOB utilization in Department procurements. Additionally, the Department summarizes its program efforts and results to both the Federal Highway Administration, and in the plans and reports required by those agencies.

## AGENCY SUMMARY AND DETAIL TABLES


<!-- image -->

The following tables provide a summary of projected appropriations, commitments, and disbursements for each agency on both a comprehensive construction program and capital projects fund basis. Immediately following the agency summary table are detailed projected disbursements for each fiscal year, beginning in FY 2025, by individual appropriation on a comprehensive construction program basis. The disbursements on these tables reflect projected spending from reappropriations and new appropriations effective for State FY 2025 and beyond, as well as appropriations anticipated to be recommended in future State fiscal years from FY 2025 through FY 2028. Spending that is not made from a capital appropriation is not reported on in the agency and summary detail tables. All amounts are in thousands of dollars.

Reappropriations and appropriations in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget represent the estimated costs for the various agencies and the respective comprehensive construction programs. Each of the reappropriations, new appropriations, and future appropriations are identified by a reference number, as required by section 22-c of the State Finance Law. These individual eight-character reference numbers are included at the end of the text for each Enacted appropriation, and the fifth and sixth characters identify the State fiscal year in which it was originally Enacted. Reference numbers for new appropriations for FY 2025 will display 24 as the fifth and sixth characters.
