| IT Guideline :                                    | Updated:  4/13/2023                                        |
| Internet Privacy Policies                         | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This guideline is designed to provide guidance in drafting Internet privacy policies for state agency websites as required by Article II of the State Technology Law ("STL"), known as the Internet Security and Privacy Act ("ISPA"). This guideline also includes a Model Internet Privacy Policy in accordance with section 203 of the STL.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYSP08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This guideline applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all

third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different guideline, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

For purposes of this guideline, "State Entities" shall include state agencies as defined in the Internet Security and Privacy Act, which is taken from the Personal Privacy Protection Law ("PPPL").

The term 'state agency website' refers to an internet website operated by or for a state agency, including those websites operated on behalf of a state agency by other public or private entities, but does not include any portions of the internet outside of the control of the state agency.

## 4.0 Information Statement

## 4.1 Introduction

The ISPA requires each SE that maintains a website to adopt and post an Internet privacy policy. This requirement reflects the recognition that citizens and businesses must be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit State Agency Websites. Pursuant to section 203(1) of the STL, ITS has specified a model Internet privacy policy for use by SEs.

This guideline highlights a number of considerations that should be taken into account in drafting an Internet privacy policy and provides an outline for the contents of an Internet privacy policy. This guideline may be used by each SE, in conjunction with the ISPA and ITS' model policy, to draft Internet privacy policies that accurately describe the practices and procedures relating to the information they collect about users through the State Agency Website and to the SE's retention and disclosure of that information.

The attached model Internet privacy policy was drafted using this guideline. This model is not intended to reflect the actual practices and procedures of any particular SE and should not be adopted by any SE without an analysis of whether the example accurately describes the SE's practices and procedures.

## 4.2 Basic Requirements for an Internet Privacy Policy

Section 203(1) of the STL requires that each Internet privacy policy include, but not be limited to, the following elements:

(a) a statement of the information, including personal information , the State Agency Website will collect with respect to the user and the purposes for which the information will be used;

(b) the circumstances under which information, including personal information, collected may be disclosed ;

(c) whether any information collected will be retained by the SE, and, if so, the period of time that such information will be retained;

(e) the means by which information is collected and whether such collection occurs actively or passively;

(d) the procedures by which a user may gain access to the collected information pertaining to that user;

(f) whether the collection of information is voluntary or required, and the consequences, if any, of a refusal to provide the required information; and

(g) the steps being taken by the SE to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information.

The elements may be addressed in any form and in any order deemed appropriate by the SE. Likewise, disclosure of the information required by a particular element may be combined with the information required by other elements. However, regardless of how the elements are organized, the information should be presented in a clear and logical manner.

Section 203(2) of the STL requires that the Internet privacy policy is posted on the State Agency Website, and that such posting "â€¦include a conspicuous and direct link to such privacy policy." ITS suggests that the required "conspicuous and direct link" is one that is identifiable, prominently displayed, easy to find, and used in a location or manner on the webpage that differs from the majority of the rest of the webpage's content by using a different font, color, background, formatting, or type size.

In connection with complying with this posting requirement, SEs should also evaluate the manner in which users access the various portions of the State Agency Website. In the event that users can directly access portions of the State Agency Website, such as surveys, registrations, order forms, or sign-in screens, which may collect information relating to the user without first visiting the State Agency's Website, the SE should consider placing links to their Internet privacy policy on those portions of the State Agency Website with such links being "conspicuous and direct" as described in the preceding paragraph.

## 4.3 Initial Steps

An SE should first determine what practices and procedures are currently in use with regard to: (1) the collection of information, including personal information, with respect to a user at its website; (2) the retention, disclosure of any information collected; and (3) the consequence of any breach of these practices and procedures (e.g., breach notification policy). Any of these current practices and procedures that involve personal information must comply with the requirements of the PPPL (Public Officers Law, Article 6-A). The PPPL specifies when an SE is authorized to maintain and disclose personal information concerning individuals.

The SE should evaluate whether all of its current practices and procedures regarding the collection of information through its website serve agency purposes. If unnecessary

information is being collected through the website, the SE should revise its practices and procedures to eliminate the collection of that information.

Because State Agency Website includes websites operated on behalf of SEs by other public or private entities, it would be appropriate for the SE to evaluate, in the manner described in the preceding paragraphs of this section, the practices and procedures of any entities with which it contracts for the operation of all, or a portion, of the SE's website. Existing contracts with other entities to operate websites on behalf of the SE may include language requiring compliance with all applicable laws, and the SE should inform those entities of the requirements of the ISPA. New contracts for the operation of a website on behalf of an SE should specifically require compliance with the provisions of the ISPA.

## 4.4 Drafting or Revising an Internet Privacy Policy

Drafting or revising an Internet privacy policy should involve ITS, including those professionals responsible for the security of the SE's information technology assets, those program staff responsible for the content of the website, the respective SE's counsel's office, the officers or employees responsible for the SE's compliance with the Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") and the PPPL, and the SE's officers and employees charged with overseeing the retention and disposition of records. The involvement of these groups will increase the likelihood that the policy will be responsive to all the statutory requirements.

To draft or revise the Internet privacy policy, it may be helpful to begin by answering the eight questions listed below. Answers to one or more of these questions may contain information that adequately addresses other required elements of the policy. Accordingly, as noted above, ITS believes that disclosure of the information required by section 203(1) of the STL need not rigidly follow the order in which the elements are presented in that section. When the technology behind a website changes, or new functionality is added to the website, the Internet privacy policy should be reviewed and revised as necessary. For example, when an SE creates a mobile version of its website, the Internet privacy policy should be reviewed for any changes needing to be specified as applicable to the mobile version.

## 4.4.1 What type of information is collected by the SE?

Identify the type of information collected about users through the State Agency Website. Such information may include, but is not limited to, the following:

a. Information collected automatically in the normal operation of the website, such as:

(i) User client hostname. The hostname or Internet Protocol address of the user requesting access to a State Agency Website.

(ii) HTTP header, "user agent." The user agent information includes the type of browser, its version, and the operating system on which the browser is running.

(iii) HTTP header, "referrer." The referrer specifies the web page from which the user accessed the current web page.

(v) Full request. The exact request the user made.

(iv) System date. The date and time of the user's request.

(vi) Status. The status code the server returned to the user.

(viii) Method. The request method used.

(vii) Content length. The content length, in bytes, of the document sent to the user.

(ix) Universal Resource Identifier (URI). The location of a resource on the server.

(xi) Protocol. The transport protocol and the version used.

(x) Query string of the URI. Anything after the question mark in a URI.

b. Any personal information relating to the user. For purposes of an Internet privacy policy, the types of information identified in paragraph (a), above, should not be considered personal information.

c. Any private information collected. "Private Information" consists of any personal information combined with any one or more of the data elements specified in section 208 of the STL including, but not limited to a social security number, a driver's license number, an account number, a credit card number, and biometric information or a username or e-mail address in combination with a password or security question and answer that would permit access to an online account.

d. Any other information collected by the SE with respect to the user that does not fall within paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), above.

## 4.4.2 How will the SE use the information it collects?

Identify the manner in which the SE will use information collected at the State Agency Website, including, at a minimum, the following:

a. A statement indicating whether and how information collected will be used for the technical support of the State Agency Website, including securing and maintaining the website. For example:

"Information, including IP addresses and domain names, is automatically logged to provide technical support for the website and its associated computer systems, to diagnose system performance or problem areas, and to detect attempts to damage or gain unauthorized access to the website and its associated computer systems."

b. A statement indicating whether and how information collected will be used for analytical and statistical purposes, including the improvement of the quality of the website. For example:

"When visiting this website, the Agency automatically collects and stores the following information about your visit:

1. The Internet Protocol address and domain name of your Internet service provider. The Internet Protocol address is a numerical identifier assigned either to your Internet service provider or directly to your computer, which can be used to direct Internet traffic to you;

3. The date and time you visited this site;

2. The type of browser and operating system you used;

4. The web pages or services you accessed at this site; and

5. The URL or web site address of the web site you visited prior to coming to this website and from which any web page on this site was linked.

This information is used to help the Agency understand how people are using this website and to improve its content. Statistical analysis may be undertaken to determine which portions of the website are visited most frequently. The information is not collected for commercial purposes and the Agency does not sell or otherwise distribute the information collected from the website for commercial purposes."

c. A statement concerning the use of information submitted voluntarily to the State Agency Website in an electronic mail message. For example:

"If during your visit to this website you send an electronic mail message to the Agency, your electronic mail address and the contents of your message will be collected. The information collected is not limited to text characters and may include audio, video, and graphic information formats included in the message. Your electronic mail address and the information included in your message will be used to respond to you, to address issues you identify, to improve this website, or to forward your message to another agency for appropriate action. Your electronic mail address is not collected for commercial purposes and the Agency does not sell or otherwise distribute your electronic mail address for commercial purposes."

d. A statement concerning the use of information submitted voluntarily to the SE when the user completes a transaction such as a survey, registration, or order form. If appropriate, the SE should provide a general description of the program for which the information is being collected. For example:

"If during your visit to this website you complete a transaction such as a survey, registration, or order form, the information, including personal information, volunteered by you is used by the Agency to operate Agency programs, which include the provision of goods, services, and information. This information is collected by the Agency and may be disclosed by the Agency for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the survey, registration, or order form in which the information was submitted."

"If during your visit to this website you place an order for a copy of a map, the Agency will request information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information, including your name and shipping address, and financial information, including your credit card number and its expiration date. This information is used to fill your order and for billing purposes. If there are difficulties in filling your order, the contact information may be used to get in touch with you."

-or-

"The Agency uses a third party to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. [Specified personal information] is shared with these entities in order to complete the transaction. These entities are not permitted to use the personal information for any other purposes."

## 4.4.3 Under what circumstances will the information collected be disclosed?

Identify the circumstances under which information, including personal information, collected will be disclosed. For example:

"Collection of information through this website and the disclosure of that information are subject to the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act. The Agency will not collect personal information through this website or disclose such information to any person, firm, partnership, corporation, limited liability company or other entity, including internal staff who do not need the information to perform their official duties, unless the user has consented to the collection or disclosure of such personal information. Voluntary disclosure of personal information to the Agency by the user constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of the information by the Agency for the purposes for which the user disclosed the information to the Agency, as was reasonably ascertainable from the nature and terms of the disclosure.

However, the Agency may collect or disclose personal information without the consent of the user if the collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of the Agency, or necessary for the Agency to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or by law; (3) for the purpose of validating the identity of the user; or (4) of information to be used solely for statistical purposes that is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular person.

Disclosure of information, including personal information, collected through this website is subject to the provisions of the New York State Freedom of Information Law and the New York State Personal Privacy Protection Law.

The Agency may disclose personal information to federal or state law enforcement authorities to enforce its rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to the Agency's information technology assets or against other inappropriate use of this website."

## 4.4.4 How long will the information collected be retained?

Indicate what types of information collected through the State Agency Website will be retained by the SE and describe, in general terms, the retention periods for those types of information. The statement should indicate whether the SE has established any records retention and disposition schedules for information collected through the website which vary from the General Retention and Disposition Schedule for New York State Government Records issued by the State Archives and Records Administration pursuant to the Arts and Cultural Affairs Law. For example:

"The information collected through this website is retained by the Agency in accordance with the records retention and disposition requirements of the New York State Arts & Cultural Affairs Law. Additional information on the requirements of the Arts & Cultural Affairs Law may be found at http://www.archives.nysed.gov/records/retention-schedules or by calling the New York State Archives at (518) 474-6926. In general, the Internet services logs of the Agency, comprising electronic files or automated logs created to monitor access and use of Agency services provided through this website, are retained for _______ [state the period that is the equivalent of three backup cycles] and then destroyed. Information, including personal information, that you submit in an electronic mail message or when you engage in a transaction such as completing a survey, registration form, or order form is retained in accordance with the records retention and disposition schedule established for the records of the program unit to which you submitted the information. Information concerning these records retention and disposition schedules may be obtained through the Internet privacy policy contact listed in this policy or by writing to the Agency at: ______________________________."

## 4.4.5 How are users provided access to personal information collected by the state agency through its website?

Under section 205 of the STL, the SE must also provide the user with the opportunity to request the correction or amendment of the personal information pertaining to such user. If the SE collects personal information pertaining to users through its State Agency Website, describe the manner in which a user may obtain access to such personal information. Access to personal information and the opportunity to request correction or amendment of such personal information is to be provided in the same manner as provided for access to and correction or amendment of personal information under section 95 of the Public Officers Law. For example:

"Any user may submit a request to the Agency privacy compliance officer to determine whether personal information pertaining to that user has been collected through this website. Any such request shall be made in writing and must be accompanied by reasonable proof of identity of the user. Reasonable proof of identity shall include, but not be limited to, verification of a signature or inclusion of an identifier generally known only to the user. The address of the privacy compliance officer is:

_________________________ ________________________ _________________________

Within five business days of the receipt of a proper request, the privacy compliance officer shall: (a) provide access to the personal information; (b) deny access to the personal information in writing, with an explanation of why the request is being denied; or (c) acknowledge the receipt of the request in writing, stating the approximate date when the request will be granted or denied, provided that the date specified shall not be more than 30 days from the date of the acknowledgment.

In the event that the Agency determines that it has collected personal information pertaining to a user through the state agency website and that information is to be provided to the user pursuant to the user's request, the privacy compliance officer shall inform the user of his or her right to request that the personal information be amended or corrected under the procedures set forth in section 95 of the Public Officers Law."

## 4.4.6 What methods are used to collect information from users?

Describe all passive information collection processes, including cookies, log files, clear gifs , and other programming, in use at the State Agency Website. If the website employs active information collection processes, the SE should describe those processes, including, but not limited to, click-throughs , surveys, registration forms, order forms, or other types of online transactions.

## 4.4.7 Is the disclosure of information by a user voluntary or required?

State whether the collection of information through the State Agency Website is voluntary or required and describe the consequences, if any, of a refusal to provide required information. For example:

"The Agency does not collect personal information about you unless you provide it voluntarily by sending an e-mail, responding to a survey, or completing an online transaction. You may choose not to send us an email, respond to a survey, or complete an online transaction. Your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your ability to receive specific services or products through this website, but it will not have an impact on

your ability to take advantage of certain other features of the website, including browsing or downloading information."

-or-

"You may configure your web browser to refuse or delete the cookies used at this website. Refusing or deleting cookies may limit your ability to take advantage of some features of this website."

## 4.4.8 How does the SE protect the confidentiality and integrity of information it collects through the website?

Describe, in general terms, the manner in which the SE protects the confidentiality and integrity of information collected through its website. The SE's description should not, however, disclose information that would jeopardize its ability to maintain the security of its information technology assets. For example:

"The Agency recognizes the need to protect personal information and private information collected through this website against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The Agency limits employee access to personal information and private information collected through this website to those employees who need access to the information to perform their official duties. Employees with access to such information are made aware of the need to follow appropriate procedures in connection with any disclosure of that information, and the state agency must adhere to applicable State information security policies available at https://its.ny.gov/policies

The Agency has implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of its information technology assets, including, but not limited to, authenticating, monitoring, auditing, and encrypting. Security procedures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of this website as part of our continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as well as the electronic transmission of information.

For website security purposes and to maintain the availability of the website for all users, the Agency employs software to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise damage this website.

It should be noted that the information provided in this privacy policy should not be construed as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided through this website."

## 4.4.9 Other Considerations

a. Each SE's Internet privacy policy should also discuss how the SE addresses the collection of information from children. For example:

"The Agency does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this website. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in electronic mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. The Agency strongly encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online."

If the State Agency Website includes an area specifically intended for use by children or if any of the transactions offered on the website are available to children, the SE should be conscious of the rules adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) pursuant to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). While COPPA generally applies only to commercial websites, the FTC encourages others to post policies and provide protections that comply with COPPA if children provide personal information at their sites. Information concerning COPPA and the FTC rules is available at

https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-andsecurity/children's-privacy

b. The SE may also wish to include contact information in the event that users have questions about the policy. At the SE's discretion, the contact for questions about the Internet privacy policy may be the employee designated to be responsible for compliance with the PPPL pursuant to section 94(1)(j) of the Public Officers Law.

c. It may also be advisable for the Internet privacy policy to clearly state that websites to which the user may be linked from the State Agency Website are not subject to that policy and providing information that links to NYS authentication services is subject to the privacy policies of such authentication service. For example:

"In order to provide users with certain information, this website provides links to the websites of local, State, and federal government agencies, and to the websites of certain other organizations. A link provided on this website does not constitute an endorsement of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, policies, products, services, or accessibility of that website. Once you link to another website from this website, including one maintained by the State, you are subject to the terms and conditions of that website, including, but not limited to, its Internet privacy policy, which has precedence for information collected by that site. Information provided to obtain authentication services such as an NY.gov ID from the https://my.ny.gov/ site used to access accounts and services of this agency is subject to the policies of such authentication service."

d. The actual practices and procedures of SEs should conform to the practices and procedures described in their Internet privacy policies. Accordingly, each

SE should establish procedures to monitor and evaluate compliance with its Internet privacy policy. Such monitoring and evaluation should include, among other things, the following:

(i) whether the posted Internet privacy policy accurately reflects the online services provided and the transactions conducted on the State Agency Website;

(iii) whether the security practices and procedures implemented in connection with the State Agency Website are adequate and effective; and

(ii) whether the posted Internet privacy policy accurately reflects the information collected through the State Agency Website and how that information is used;

(iv) whether the Internet privacy policy posted on the State Agency Website conforms to the provisions of the ISPA, the FOIL, and the PPPL, and all other relevant laws, regulations, or policies.

## 4.5 Model Internet Privacy Policy

Please note that the Internet Privacy Policy set forth below is intended to be a model of a policy drafted using this best practice guideline distributed by ITS. This model is not intended to reflect the actual practices and procedures of any particular SE and should not be adopted by any SE without an analysis of whether the model accurately describes the SE's practices and procedures.

## INTERNET PRIVACY POLICY

## Introduction

Thank you for visiting the Generic State Agency (GSA) website. This website is designed to make it easier and more efficient for individuals and businesses to interact with the GSA. The GSA recognizes that it is critical for individuals and businesses to be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit the GSA's website.
