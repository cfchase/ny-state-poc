| Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner:  Chief Information Security Office | Sanitization/Secure  Disposal |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

Information systems capture, process, and store information using a wide variety of media, including paper. This information is not only located on the intended storage media but also on devices used to create, process, or transmit this information. These media may require special disposition in order to mitigate the risk of unauthorized disclosure of information and to ensure its confidentiality.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business reengineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all

third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

This standard covers all media containing SE information regardless of the classification of the information stored, format or location, including that which is held by third parties on behalf of the SE. Electronic media may be contained in or be a part of personal or laptop computers, printers, scanners, fax machines, mobile devices, copiers, or other devices which may allow temporary or permanent storage of information.

## 4.0 Information Statement

As per the NYSP03-002 Information Security Policy, information must be properly managed from its creation, through authorized use, to proper disposal. The SE must classify the information to be stored on the media according to the NYS-S14-002 Information Classification Standard, whether the data is encrypted or not. Without classification, the risk of an SE losing control of media containing sensitive information is greatly increased.

The SE must ensure that users and custodians of information are aware of its sensitivity and the basic requirements for media sanitization and secure disposal.

The SE must ensure that all workforce members, including property management and custodial staff, are made aware of the media sanitization and secure disposal process in order to establish proper accountability for all information.

The SE must ensure that confidential material is destroyed only by authorized and trained personnel, whether in-house or contracted, using methods outlined in this standard.

The SE may use service providers for destruction purposes provided that the information remains secure until the destruction is completed. The service providers must follow this standard. The SE must ensure that maintenance or contractual agreements are in place and are sufficient in protecting the confidentiality of the system media and information commensurate with the information classification standards.

## Methods of Media Sanitization

The following table depicts the three types of sanitization methods and the impact of each method.


| Sanitization  Method   | Appropriate Use                                                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Clear                  | If the media will be reused and  will not be leaving the SE's  control. | Protects  confidentiality  of  information against an attack by  replacing written data  with  random data. Clearing must not  allow  information  to  be  retrieved by data, disk or file  recovery utilities. |
| Purge                  | If the media will be reused and  leaving the SE's control.              | Protects  confidentiality  of  information against an attack  through either degaussing or  secure erase.                                                                                                       |
| Physical  Destruction  | If the media will not be reused at  all.                                | Intent is to completely destroy  the media.                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Sanitization Decision Process

The decision process is based on the confidentiality of the information, not the type of media. The SEs choose the type of sanitization to be used and the type of sanitization is approved by the Information Owner. The technique used may vary by media type and by the technology available to the custodian, so long as the requirements of the sanitization type are met. Recommended sanitization techniques for specific types of media are outlined in NIST 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, Appendix A Minimum Sanitization Recommendations.

Disposal without sanitization should be considered only if information disclosure would have no impact on organizational mission, would not result in damage to organizational assets, and would not result in financial loss or harm to any individuals.

The classification of the information, along with internal environmental factors, should drive the decisions on how to deal with the media. The key is to first think in terms of information confidentiality, then apply considerations based on media type.

The cost versus benefit of a sanitization process should be understood prior to a final decision. SEs can always increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable and indicated by an assessment of the existing risk. For example, even though Clear or Purge may be the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and verification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options. SEs may not decrease the level of sanitization required. If the SE has not identified the classification of information on media, the disposition should follow the sanitization method for confidential information.

## Control of Media

A factor influencing an SE sanitization decision is who has control and access to the media. This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media control may be transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being donated or resold to be reused outside the organization. The following are examples of media control:

## Under SE Control:

路 Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under SE control if contractual agreements are in place with the SE and the maintenance provider specifically provides for the confidentiality of the information.

路 Maintenance being performed on an SE's site, under the SE's supervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered under the control of the SE.

## Not Under SE Control:

路 Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes and where the specific media will not be returned to the SE are considered to be out of SE control.

路 Important Note: As data and assets of various types and classifications are established or migrated into the Cloud infrastructures of third-party hosting partners, this Standard will continue to apply. If data classified as High is to be stored with a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), the physical data storage must be destroyed after use, and the SE would need to ensure that the destruction was completed by the CSP and that proof of destruction was provided at that time.$_{ }$

## Reuse of Media

SEs should consider the cost versus benefit of reuse. It may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and verification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other sanitization options.

## Clear / Purge / Destroy

The table below gives a general explanation of the options for sanitization. Recommended sanitization techniques for specific types of media are outlined in NIST 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, Appendix A - Minimum Sanitization Recommendations.

| Clear    | One method to sanitize media is to use software or hardware products to overwrite  user- addressable storage space on the media with non-sensitive data, using the  standard read and write commands for the device. This process may include  overwriting not only the logical storage location of a file(s) (e.g., file allocationtable) but  also should include all user- addressable locations. The security goal of the overwriting  process is to replace Target Data with non-sensitive data. Overwriting cannot be used  for media that are damaged or not rewriteable and may not address all areas of the  device where sensitive data may be retained. The media type and size may also  influence whether overwriting is a suitable sanitization method. For example, flash  memory-based storage devices may contain spare cells and perform wear levelling,  making it infeasible for a user to sanitize all previous data using this approach because  thedevicemay notsupport directly addressingall areas wheresensitivedatahas been  stored using the native read and writeinterface. |
|          | The Clear operation may vary contextually for media other than dedicated storage  devices, where the device (such as a basic cell phone or a piece of office equipment)  only provides the ability to return the device to factory state (typically by simply deleting  the file pointers) and does not directly support the ability to rewrite or apply media- specific techniques to the non-volatile storage contents. Where rewriting is not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Some methods of purging (which vary by media and must be applied with  considerations described further throughout this document) include overwrite, block  erase, and Cryptographic Erase, through the use of dedicated, standardized device  sanitize commands that apply media-specific techniques to bypass the abstraction  inherent in typical read and write commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

However,  Bending,Cutting,and the use of some emergencyprocedures (such as using a firearm  to shoot a hole through a storage device) may only damage the media as portions of  the media may remain undamaged and therefore accessible using advanced  laboratory techniques.                                                                                             |

## Validation

SEs must test a representative sampling of media for proper sanitization to ensure that proper protection is maintained.

## Verification of Equipment

If the SE is using sanitization tools (e.g., a degausser), the SE must have procedures to ensure that the tools are operating effectively.

## Verification of Personnel Competencies

SEs must ensure that equipment operators are properly trained and competent to perform sanitization functions.
