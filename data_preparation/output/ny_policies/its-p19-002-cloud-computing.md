## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This policy mandates the utilization of the NY State Private Cloud. The NY State Private Cloud is a hybrid cloud that is managed by the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS). The NY State Private Cloud provides a secure, resilient, and zero emission data center facility. It provides fully managed, monitored, and protected core network, compute, and platforms necessary to host business applications.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 1 of Executive Order No. 117 1 charges the State Chief Information Officer with overseeing and supervising the management and operations of ITS . Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in New York State (NYS) ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, interns, and ITS supported agencies ("Client Agency").

## 4.0 Information Statement

ITS and all ITS client agencies must use the NY State Private Cloud for cloud-based service offerings, including but not limited to:

· Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

· Serverless Computing or Function Platform as a Service (fPaaS)

Application Platform as a Service (aPaaS) or Platform as a Service (Paas)

No-Code/Low Code Cloud Platforms or High-Productivity Platform as a Service (hpPaaS)

· Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings that are offered by ITS

The NY State Private Cloud may include services in public or private facilities based on compliance with security requirements.

The NY State Private Cloud is a framework of services that provide New York State entities with secure technology services and solutions. NY State Private Cloud provides a set of shared core technology services including, but not limited to, User Identity, Network Domain Naming, IT Service Management (ITSM), Monitoring, and Security Logging.

Third-Party Cloud services can integrate with the NY State Private Cloud framework. In this context, a Third-Party cloud refers to any external cloud hosting not directly managed by ITS. Integration requires that Third-Party Cloud services utilize core or enterprise services consistent with ITS Technical Standards and meet or exceed the security and legal requirements associated with State data.

## 4.1 Roles and Responsibilities

## 4.1.1 Authorization to Use a Third-Party Cloud

The authorization to use a Third-party cloud may only be granted by the NYS Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or an assigned designee. ITS shall keep an approved list of authorized designees.

## 4.1.2 Information Owner Responsibility

All data security requirements, including identifying geographic residency, are the responsibility of the agency information owners (see "Determining the Information Owner" in the NYS-S14-002: Information Classification Standard).

Placement of data at rest will be based on the data requirements as identified by the information owners. Compliance may limit the use of services or require that data reside at specific facilities.

## 4.2 Service Offering Governance

## 4.2.1 ITS as a Cloud Broker

As the State's Cloud Broker, ITS may source and integrate Third-party clouds to deliver IT services. SEs may not independently procure Third-party cloud services without ITS CTO pre-approval.

## 4.2.2 Third-Party SaaS Offerings

ITS client agencies may select third party SaaS services based on their business requirements; however, procurements of SaaS services must comply with all applicable ITS Policies and Technical Standards. The contract with the Third-party cloud offeror must include language binding contractors to monitor policy changes, report any deficiencies, and either request exceptions or remediate any deficiencies.

## 5.0 Compliance

This policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

If compliance with this policy is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, SEs shall submit a written request for an exception to the CTO. The CTO will issue a written approval or denial of the request.
