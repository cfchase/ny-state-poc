| IT Standard :  Updated:  08/24/2023                        |                       |
| Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services | Authentication Tokens |

## $^{ }$1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The purpose of this standard is to list the appropriate authentication tokens that can be used with systems developed or operated for New York State (NYS) that require authenticated access depending on the Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). This document also provides the requirements for management of those authentication devices.

## $^{ }$2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology Policies, Standards, and Guidelines

## 3.0 Scope

This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## 4.0 Information Statement

## 4.1 Assurance Levels and Required Token Types

The AAL of a system determines the degree of certainty required when authenticating a user. The following table describes the level of confidence associated with each AAL. These levels of assurance are consistent with those established by the US Federal Government for use by federal agencies. For a full summary of AAL Requirements see Appendix A.

Table 1: Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL)
| Level                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Definition   |

| Provides some assurance that the claimant controls an  "authenticator" bound to the subscriber's account. AAL1  requires either single-factor (e.g., password) or multi- factor  (e.g., password + token) authentication using a wide range  of available authentication technologies. Successful  authentication requires that the individual logging in prove  possession and control of the authenticator through a  secure authentication protocol as defined in the NYS-S14- 007 Encryption Standard. | AAL1         |
| Provides high confidence that the claimant controls  authenticator(s) bound to the subscriber's account. Proof  of possession and control of two distinct authentication  factors (multi-factor) is required through secure  authentication protocol(s). Approved cryptographic  techniques, as defined in the NYS-S14-007 Encryption  Standard, are required at AAL2 and above.                                                                                                                           | AAL2         |




SEs must follow the Digital Identity Policy, NYS-P20-001 Digital Identity Policy, to determine the appropriate assurance level for their system. For token distribution requirements refer to the Digital Identity Standard, NYS-S20-001 Digital Identity Standard.

Each assurance level requires different authentication tokens which incorporate one or more authentication factors (i.e., something you know, something you have, and something you are). AAL1 requires a minimum of single factor authentication. AAL2 and AAL3 require multifactor authentication.

SEs must choose the appropriate token type(s) for their assurance level. Table 1 explains what token is required based on assurance level, and Table 2 shows the maximum assurance level that can be achieved with a single token type.

## 4.2 Authentication Token Types

## 4.2.1 Memorized Secret Token

A memorized secret token is something you know. Memorized secret tokens are typically character or numerical strings. Examples include passwords, passphrases, and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).

Typically, a memorized secret token is used on its own for AAL1. AAL2 and AAL3 require multi-factor authentication (MFA). When a memorized secret token is used as one of the factors in a multi-factor authentication solution, the token requirements at the associated AAL apply.

The following table addresses the minimum requirements regarding memorized secret tokens. It is important to note that other requirements dictated by regulatory bodies

$^{ }$

(i.e., IRS for Federal Tax Information) may have different requirements. An SE's relevant compliance domains should be consulted to address the authentication needs of a system and if different from this standard, a security exception must be filed with the ITS Chief Information Security Office (CISO) per the Information Security Exception Policy, NYS-P13-001 Information Security Exception Policy.

## 4.2.2 Look-Up Secrets

A look-up secret is something you know, and a CSP/verifier has. It is either a physical or electronic record that stores a set of secrets shared between the user and CSP. An authenticator is used to look up the appropriate secret(s) needed to respond to a prompt from the verifier. An example is the use of a look-up secret as a "recovery key" for use when another authenticator is lost or malfunctions.

Look-up secrets are commonly used at AAL1. AAL2 and AAL3 require multifactor authentication. When combined with a memorized secret, the rules at AAL2 apply.

Authenticator Requirements Look-up secrets must have at least 20 bits of entropy and must be distributed over a secure channel.

## 4.2.3 Out-of-Band (OOB) Token

OOB tokens are something you have. They are a combination of a physical device (e.g., cellular phone, PDA, pager, land line) and a secret that is transmitted to the device over a distinct communications channel, by a verifier for one-time use.

An example of an OOB token would be a user logging into a website and receiving a text message or phone call on their cellular phone (pre-registered with the CSP during the registration phase) with a random authenticator to be presented as part of the electronic authentication protocol. E-mail cannot be used to transmit the random authenticator for the OOB device.

Authenticator Requirements - The device must be possessed and controlled by the user and be uniquely addressable. The authenticator must establish a separate channel with the verifier to retrieve the out-of-band secret or authentication request. The secondary channel is considered out-of-band (even if it terminates on the same device) if the device does not leak information from one channel to the other without authorization from the claimant.

Use of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is restricted unless the preregistered telephone number in use is associated with a specific physical device. Changing the pre-registered telephone number is equivalent to the binding of a new authenticator and should follow applicable requirements. Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) or email cannot be used for OOB authentication.

Token Requirements - The token must be possessed and controlled by the user, uniquely addressable and must support communication over a channel/protocol that is separate from the primary channel/protocol for e-authentication.

Uniquely addressable means that the token can be addressed by a unique characteristic (e.g., phone number).

When accessing an application via a mobile device and using a virtual phone and communications management system (e.g., Google Voice), then that mobile device will not be viable as an OOB token as there is no separate channel/protocol for communication of the random authenticator.

A limitation with the use of OOB tokens is that if the device is infected, even if the communication occurs over a separate channel/protocol, both forms of authentication (application access and receipt of token) are compromised, and all communication is therefore un-trusted.

Verifier Requirements - The maximum time-period that an OOB token can exist is 10 minutes and it can only be used once. The verifier-generated secret must have at a minimum 20 bits of entropy; however, any authentication secret that has less than 64 bits of entropy must limit the number of failed authentication attempts to no more than 100.

## 4.2.4 Single Factor (SF) Cryptographic Device

SF cryptographic devices are something you have. It is a hardware device that performs cryptographic operations on input provided to the device. It does not require a second factor. Generally, it is a signed message. An example would be a Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Services (SSL/TLS) certificate.

Authenticator Requirements - The cryptographic modules used shall be validated at FIPS 140-3, Level 1 or higher. Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable.

Verifier Requirements - The input (e.g., a nonce or challenge) to generate the token has at least 64 bits of entropy and shall either be unique over the authenticator's lifetime, or statistically unique using an approved random bit generator. Verification must use approved cryptography.

## 4.2.5 Single-Factor (SF) One-Time Password (OTP) Device

SF OTP devices are something you have. This category includes hardware devices and software-based OTP generators installed on devices such as mobile phones. This device has an embedded secret that is used as the seed for generation of OTPs and does not require activation through a second factor. Authentication is accomplished by providing an acceptable OTP and thereby proving user possession and control of the device. The device is used each time authentication is required.

Examples include key fob tokens, or software-based OTP generator. A user attempts to log into a website and provides a token generated code or OTP.

Authenticator Requirements - An approved block cipher or hash function to combine a symmetric key stored on the device with a nonce to generate an OTP must be used. The nonce may be a date and time or a counter generated on the device.

Verifier Requirements - The OTP shall have a limited lifetime, with a maximum of 2 minutes. The cryptographic module performing the verifier functions shall be validated at FIPS 140-3 Level 1 or higher. Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable.

## 4.2.6 Multi-Factor (MF) Software Cryptographic Token

A MF software cryptographic token is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are. It is a cryptographic key that is stored on a disk or some other "soft" media and must be unlocked through a second factor of authentication separate from the authentication factor used to access the disk or other "soft" media.

Authentication is accomplished by proving possession and control of the key. The token is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message.

An example would be a private cryptographic certificate that is unlocked by a passphrase that is separate from that which unlocks the device on which the certificate is stored. The certificate deployed on the user's workstation (something you have) in combination with a passphrase (something you know) provides multi-factor authentication. The password to access the device cannot automatically unlock the certificate.

Authenticator Requirements - The cryptographic module shall be validated at FIPS 140-3 Level 1 or higher. Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable. Each authentication shall require entry of the password or other activation data and the unencrypted copy of the authentication key shall be erased after each authentication.

Verifier Requirements - Verifier generated token input (e.g., a nonce or challenge) has at least 64 bits of entropy.

## 4.2.7 Multi-Factor (MF) One-Time Password (OTP) Device

A MF OTP device is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are. It is a hardware and software-based device that generates OTPs for use in authentication and which must be unlocked through a second factor of authentication. The second factor of authentication may be achieved through an integral entry pad, an integral biometric (e.g., fingerprint) reader or a direct computer interface (e.g., USB port).

The OTP is typically displayed on the device and manually input to the verifier as a password, although direct electronic input from the device to a computer is also allowed.

An example would be a key fob token in combination with a PIN. A user attempts to log into a website and provides a user-defined PIN (established when the token was assigned) and a token generated code. The combination of the PIN and token generated code is referred to as a passcode.

Authenticator Requirements - The cryptographic module shall be validated at FIPS 140-3 Level 2 or higher with the token itself meeting physical security at FIPS 140-3 Level 3 or higher. This means the token is tamper proof; it can't be broken open to reverse engineer or get a seed value, etc. Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable. Refer to the NYS-S14-007 Encryption Standard for additional information.

The OTP must be generated using an approved block cipher or hash function to combine a symmetric key stored on a personal hardware device with a nonce to generate an OTP. The nonce may be a date and time or a counter generated on the device. Each authentication shall require entry of a password or other activation data through an integrated input mechanism.

Verifier Requirements - The OTP shall have a limited lifetime, with a maximum of 2 minutes.

## 4.2.8 Multi-Factor (MF) Cryptographic Device

A MF cryptographic device is something you have, and it must be unlocked by either something you know or something you are. It is a hardware device that contains a protected cryptographic key that must be unlocked through a second authentication factor.

Authentication is accomplished by proving possession of the device and control of the key. The token is highly dependent on the specific cryptographic device and protocol, but it is generally some type of signed message. For example, in Transport Layer Services (TLS), there is a "certificate verify" message. An example would be an ATM card.

Authenticator Requirements - Cryptographic module shall be FIPS 140-3 validated, Level 2 or higher; with the token itself meeting physical security at FIPS 140-3 Level 3 or higher. This means the token is tamper proof; it can't be broken open to reverse engineer or get a seed value, etc. Products validated under subsequent versions of FIPS 140 are also acceptable.

Entry of a password, PIN, or biometric is required to activate the authentication key. The export of authentication keys is not allowed.

Verifier Requirements - Verifier generated token input (e.g., a nonce or challenge) has at least 64 bits of entropy.

## 4.3 Token Renewal/Re-issuance

Some token types support the process of renewal, while some support re-issuance. Depending on the assurance level, the user will need to re-establish their identity with the CSP if the token has expired or prove possession of the unexpired token before renewal or re-issuance occurs. Refer to the NYS-S20-001 Digital Identity Standard for additional information.
