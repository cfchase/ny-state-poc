Information system vulnerability management must be included in risk management processes to ensure that they are reviewed and responded to appropriately because significant vulnerabilities may change current strategic risk management decisions. For example, a newly identified vulnerability found in a business-critical system may

require an immediate fix. At the same time, another vulnerability may exist in components of several less critical systems. The SE must assess and prioritize responses to both vulnerabilities within the context of other risk management activities. Additional requirements for vulnerability management are found in the NYS-S15002 Vulnerability Management Standard.

## **4.3 Assess Risk**

Risk assessments identify, prioritize, and help an SE to estimate the level of risk associated with SE operations (i.e., mission, functions, image, and reputation), assets, individuals, external entities, etc., resulting from the operation and use of information systems and other sources.

The goal of a risk assessment is to identify:

· Threats (both internal and external) to the organization's operations, assets, individuals, or systems;

· Impact, the level of harm (i.e., consequence), to the SE that may occur if apotential threat exploits a vulnerability; and

· Vulnerabilities, or weaknesses, that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the assessed system, process, or other source;

· Likelihood that the event will occur.

Risk assessment results incorporate the impact (level of harm) and likelihood of the event. The following formula is used to assign a risk rating: risk = impact * likelihood. Qualitative (high, moderate, low) or quantitative ratings must be documented and assigned, with justification, for both impact and likelihood. Exhibit 1, Calculating Risk, outlines this process in more detail.

SE risk assessments must include:

· Roles, responsibilities, and communication channels;

· Any assumptions or constraints;

· Tools, techniques, and methodologies (e.g., quantitative, qualitative, or semiquantitative) used to assess risk;

· How threat information is obtained (i.e., sources and methods);
