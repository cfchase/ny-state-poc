# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The purpose of this policy is to establish the requirement for a case-by-case review of all requests to conduct NYS business activities from international locations that require access to non-public NYS systems or data.

A State Entity (SE) must review its business needs and technical requirements prior to approving access to non-public NYS systems and data from international locations in each instance due to the unique laws, regulations, and varying levels of risk in any given international location. This policy benefits SEs by ensuring that they have appropriately reviewed an individual request for international access and put appropriate safeguards in place to limit the risk of this access.

Failure to perform a review and implement appropriate safeguards could have a significant detrimental impact on non-public NYS systems or data beyond the scope of the individual SE.
