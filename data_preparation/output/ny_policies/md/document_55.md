The NYS-S15-002 Vulnerability Management Standard requires that systems undergo source code analysis before moving between environments if there has been a change to application code. As per NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy and NYS-S15-002 Vulnerability Management Standard appropriate action must be taken to address discovered vulnerabilities.

This process is often done by:

· Peer Review - programmers with extensive knowledge and experience who did not author the code review the code to ensure it follows established secure coding principles and best practices.

· Automated Testing - automated programs can be used to check the security of an application using static and dynamic analysis tools.

 Static analysis tools - analyze the source code of an application without executing the application. Static code scanning is done throughout the development process as well as prior to being moved into the production environment.

 Dynamic analysis tools - analyze the application during execution in a runtime environment.

When software development is outsourced, SEs must verify that the software assurance model used by the vendor is in line with this standard through SE security testing and/or contract requirements.
