Finally, it is important to note that the SSDLC process is intentionally comprehensive, to assure due-diligence, compliance, and proper documentation of security-related controls and considerations. Designing security into systems requires an investment of time and resources. The extent to which security is applied to the SSDLC process should be commensurate with the classification (data sensitivity and system criticality) of the system being developed and risks the system may introduce into the overall environment. This ensures value to the development process and deliverables. Generally speaking, the best return on investment is achieved by rigorously applying security within the SSDLC process to high risk/cost projects. Where it is determined that a project will not leverage the full SSDLC process - for example, on a lower-risk/cost project, the rationale must be documented, and the security activities that are not used must be identified and approved as part of the formal risk acceptance process.

Note: Data classification cannot be used as the sole determinate of whether the project is low risk/cost. For example, public facing websites cannot be considered low risk/cost projects even if all the data is public. Public facing websites may be subject to the risk of malware injections, compromise of visitor's machines, or alteration of website content, which could lead to reputational damage.

## **Appendix A: Security Activities within the SSDLC**

There are many different industry accepted SDLC frameworks that can be used and researched. The actual placement of security activities may vary in accordance with the actual SDLC framework being utilized in a project, and the particular security needs of the application or system. There are also many other activities that may be included based on the framework used.

The table below illustrates the recommended placement of required security activities within the phases of a sample SDLC (Figure A-1). These are examples and therefore are not inclusive of all possible placements or activities.

In addition, many security activities are iterative and may extend between multiple phases. Appendix B contains description of each of the security activities in the standard.
