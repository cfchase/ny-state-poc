## **4.5 Restricted Periods Under the NYS Procurement Lobbying Law**

ITS will treat each PTP request received as if a restricted period under the NYS Procurement Lobbying Law is in place. As part of the PTP submittal, the requesting SE must include a list of designated contacts, along with contact information, for the proposed procurement.

ITS staff will not engage in any conversations with relevant vendors regarding the PTPs. SE must advise vendors not to lobby or engage in any manner with ITS with respect to an SE PTP. Any attempt to influence, in any way, a PTP disposition by a vendor may result in an undesirable disposition.
