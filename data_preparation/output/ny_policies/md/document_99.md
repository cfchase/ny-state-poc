· This will allow the identification of any "blind spots" that were discovered within the organization during the incident. This process will allow for future strengthening of the systems that were compromised along with the identification of any other systems that may be at risk.

**2** Finalize Reports

· Provide post-incident updates and documentation as required by law and policy.

· Incident documentation must be retained by the SE based on any regulatory, records retention, or compliance requirements.

## **3. Perform Lesson Learned Activities**

· These activities can be the results of actual IR activities or IR capability testing and they should happen relatively soon after the incident is closed. They should include, at a minimum, a recap of the steps involved in response tothe incident, results of the root cause analysis, along with any potential improvement to the process and procedures. Both incident reports and the results of these lesson-learned discussions must be documented for future use and shared with all IR stakeholders for situational awareness and professional development.

## **4.3 Coordination**

Coordination is foundational to effective IR. It is critical that the SE experiencing the incident coordinate early and often throughout the response process with all relevant IR stakeholders and partners. SEs may need to interact with several types of external organizations while conducting IR activities. Examples of these organizations include other IR teams, DHSES OEM, law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers, constituents, and customers. An SE's IR team should plan its incident coordination with those parties before incidents occur to ensure that all parties know their roles and that effective lines of communication are established.

Key aspects of coordination include:

· Plan incident coordination with external parties before incidents occur.

· Consult with counsel before initiating any coordination efforts.

· Perform incident information sharing throughout the incident response life cycle.

· Attempt to automate as much of the information sharing process as possible.

· Balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive information.

· Share as much of the appropriate incident information as possible with other organizations.

· Any required mandated notifications should be followed. (e.g., NYS Information Security Breach Notification Act ["ISBNA"])

## **4.4 Incident Response (IR) Metrics**

SEs should compile IR metrics for each incident for overall situational awareness when possible and practical. In addition, these metrics can be used for periodic reporting purposes.

These metrics allow IR stakeholders (1) to measure IR effectiveness (and reveal potential gaps) over time; (2) to identify trends in terms of threat activities; and (3) to provide justification for additional resources (personnel, training, and tools) . Example metrics are below:
