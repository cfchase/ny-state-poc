ESRA's purpose is to facilitate e-Commerce and e-Government in New York State by giving electronic signatures and records (e-signatures and e-records) the same force and effect as signatures and records produced by non-electronic means. 1 In most cases, the use and acceptance of e-signatures or e-records is completely voluntary, as ESRA does not require private parties or governmental entities to use or accept e-signatures or erecords, unless some other law provides otherwise. The ESRA Guidelines are designed for governmental entities, but private individuals and entities may also find them helpful. ESRA regulatory changes or other developments may be noted on ITS' webpage: https://its.ny.gov/electronic-signatures-and-records-act-esra.

Governmental entities that use and accept e-records must also ensure their authenticity, integrity, and security and, when appropriate, their confidentiality (see Title 9 NYCRR Part 540.5(d)).

These guidelines are organized into two major sections concerning:
