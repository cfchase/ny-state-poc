## **2. Establish Digital Identity Requirements**

As per the NYS-P20-001: Digital Identity Policy, SEs must ensure all applications or systems which require authentication must establish an authorized account credential. Establishing digital identity requirements will ensure that access control of an application or system meets the requirements specified.

## **3. Create a System Configuration Profile and Decompose the System**

The system or application being developed must be iteratively profiled by technical teams within the SSDLC. A system profile is a high-level overview of the system or application that identifies the system or application's attributes such as the physical topology, the logical tiers, components, services, actors, technologies, external dependencies, and access rights. This profile must be updated throughout the various phases of the SSDLC upon any changes to the design and/or architecture of the system or application. The system or application must be decomposed into finer components and its mechanics (i.e., the inner workings) must be documented. This activity is to be iteratively performed within the SSDLC. Decomposition should include production data flow and network diagrams to identify trust boundaries, information entry and exit points, data flows, and privileged functions.

## **4. Assess Risks**

As per the NYS-S14-001: Information Security Risk Management Standard, SEs must iteratively perform risk assessments within the SSDLC process that include vulnerability scanning. Risk assessments begin as an informal, high-level process early in the SSDLC and will evolve throughout the life cycle of the development process. The result is a formal, comprehensive risk assessment process that is executed prior to placing a system or application into production.

All significant threats and vulnerabilities identified via risk assessments must be addressed by the SE, and SEs must appropriately manage all identified risks by avoiding, transferring, accepting, or mitigating the risk. Ignoring risk is prohibited. Risk assessments must adhere to all relevant state and federal mandates that the SE must document and be compliant with.
