## **2. Classification of Information Assets**

Information owners must answer the questions in the Information Asset Classification Worksheet (Appendix A) to determine the classification of their information assets. Questions are categorized by confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each question must be answered sequentially to the best of the information owners' abilities.

Information owners should consult with subject matter experts who have specific knowledge about the information asset, such as their Counsel's Office and the Records Management Officer. The Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative may also be called upon to advise and assist the information

owner in determining the classification. An SE may add more questions to the Information Asset Classification Worksheet but may not alter or remove the original questions.

Information assets are classified according to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each of these three security principles is individually rated as low, moderate, or high. For example, an information asset may have a confidentiality level of "high", an integrity level of "moderate", and an availability level of "low" (i.e., HML).

## **3. Determination of Controls**

After the classification has been determined, the resultant rating is used to determine the security controls required to appropriately protect the information. When determining the appropriate controls, SEs must review and select controls that correspond to the highest information classification rating in any category (e.g., a "high-water" mark). For example, a low-impact system is defined as a system in which all three information classification ratings are low. A moderate-impact system is defined as a system in which at least one rating is moderate and no ratings are high. A high-impact system is defined as a system in which at least one rating is high.
