· Redirect options are not within the SE's control. The state is unable to exercise full control over banner advertisement "redirects" that may result in unintended consequences to the user and/or the SE. Individuals "clicking" on a banner advertisement have little or no control of the redirect options to return the user

to the original website. Re-routed advertising links can result in the user being linked to questionable or problematic websites, which may negatively impact the state's image.

## **4.3 Links and Endorsements on Websites**

· Links to federal, state, and local government websites are generally appropriate.

· Links that provide access to a website which contains software that is necessary or enhances the operation of the site (e.g., PDF viewer) are generally appropriate.

· An SE should limit external linking to information or services necessary for the proper performance of an SE function or in furtherance of the SE's mission. SEs should not provide links to private businesses, unless all such businesses are provided equal access, a formal business partnership has been established, and/or the reason for the link is primarily educational or informational in nature.

· The SE's website should contain a statement that the links do not constitute endorsements, including a disclaimer. An SE should consult with their legal counsel prior posting any such statement. A sample statement and disclaimer follow:
