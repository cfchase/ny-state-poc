including technology and security standards. Executive Order No. 117 1 , established in January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business reengineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology Policies, Standards, and Guidelines.

## **3.0 Scope**

This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## **4.1 IR Stakeholders**

To respond effectively to an incident, it is critical that all IR stakeholders understand not only their roles in the IR process, but also the role of other stakeholders. This is necessary to (1) avoid duplication of effort; (2) minimize procedural gaps that may occur; and (3) ensure rapid response to incidents. Appendix E provides a description for the State Agency Division of Authority.
