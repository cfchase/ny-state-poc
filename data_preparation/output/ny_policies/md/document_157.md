# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

This Standard establishes authorized methods for remotely accessing New York State (NYS) resources and services securely.

Major security concerns with remote access include the lack of physical security controls, the use of unsecured networks, the connection of infected devices to internal networks, the availability of internal resources to external hosts, potential damage to State resources, and unauthorized access to State information. This Standard attempts to address these concerns.
