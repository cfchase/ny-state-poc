CPE credits are given for related experience outside of normal on-the-job duties. For instance, while time spent independently preparing an information security presentation for a community organization would qualify for CPE credits, an equivalent amount of time spent on the job preparing a staff presentation, other internal publications or events would NOT qualify.

CPE credits are weighted by activity. Below are common categories of activities and the number of credits earned for each. These activities are not intended to be a complete listing, as many other events such as graduate work in an appropriate academic field, may also qualify. Typically, you will earn 1 CPE credit for each hour spent engaged in an educational activity. However, some activities are worth more CPEs, due to the depth of study or ongoing commitment involved. CPE activities include but are not limited to:

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a security educational training course or seminar.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a security conference. The New York State (NYS) Cyber Security Conference qualifies for CPE credits.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a State information security community of practice meeting (IS-CoP) or NYS Forum information security workgroup meeting.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a professional security association chapter meeting, such as the ISC2, Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), ISACA, etc.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a higher education course within the scope of information security domains. A maximum of 40 CPEs may be earned per course. Credit will only be given on passing the course successfully.
