**a** All systems, and the physical facilities in which they are stored, must have documented operating instructions, management processes, and formal incident management procedures related to information security matters which define roles and responsibilities of affected individuals who operate or use them.

**b** Any systems or services operated outside of CONUS must not connect to State networks or the State datacenter.

**c** System configurations must follow approved configuration standards.

**d** Advance planning and preparation must be performed to ensure the availability of adequate capacity and resources. System capacity must be monitored on an ongoing basis.

**e** Where a SE provides a server, application, or network service to another SE, operational and management responsibilities must be coordinated by all impacted SEs.

**f** Host based firewalls must be installed and enabled on all SE workstations to protect from threats and to restrict access to only that which is needed.

**g** Controls must be implemented (e.g., anti-virus, software integrity checkers, web filtering) across SE systems where technically feasible to prevent and detect the introduction of malicious code or other threats.

**h** Controls must be implemented to disable automatic execution of content f rom removable media.

**i** Controls must be implemented to limit storage of SE information to SE authorized locations.

**j** Controls must be in place to allow only SE approved software to run on a system and prevent execution of all other software.

**k** All systems must be maintained at a vendor-supported level to ensure accuracy and integrity.

**l** All security patches must be reviewed, evaluated, and appropriately applied in a timely manner. This process must be automated, where technically possible.

**m** Any system, software, or Operating System environment which is no longer supported and cannot be patched to current versions (e.g. end of life hardware/software) must be decommissioned and removed from service.

**n** Systems and applications must be monitored and analyzed to detect deviation from the access control requirements outlined in this policy and the Security Logging Standard, and must record events to provide evidence and to reconstruct lost or damaged information.
