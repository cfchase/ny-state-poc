[4] What is the financial impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information?

Example(s): There are many financial implications for the destruction or modification of information. It does not strictly mean monetary loss but can also include loss of employee time and effort for recovery. Something that would have severe financial impact might be the loss of all financial records from a State Entity's financial management database.

If a database of vendor contact information was deleted, it would involve effort in re-creating the database. This would probably be of limited impact.

[5] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the SE mission?

Example(s): State Entity operations could be drastically affected if information is changed without authorization. For example, if someone removed all the phone numbers in a Do Not Call registry, it would severely impact the mission of the program to prevent unwanted calls to registered numbers.

The mission of a university is to provide education and certify the qualifications of students through academic degrees. Malicious or accidental changes to student academic records would have a severe impact on the university's mission of issuing academic credentials.

[6] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the public trust?

Example(s): The public relies on government to provide accurate information. Failure to do so would erode public trust. For example, if information on certification for licensed professionals was inaccurately modified without authorization and then posted to a public web site, the public would no longer trust the State Entity posting the information as a reputable source for this information.

[7] Is integrity addressed by law or regulation? If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information.

Example(s): Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records, may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws. Allowing unauthorized changes to information may have legal consequences. There are several key statutes that should be examined based on the information asset being classified. For example, HIPAA requires safeguards to protect against threats to the integrity of electronic protected health information.
