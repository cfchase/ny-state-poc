The SE may use AI systems to further their mission and meet critical business needs. The use of AI, even if not subject to this policy, must be in compliance with applicable New York State and ITS policies and standards and New York and federal law. Particular attention should be made to the use of Open-Source AI to ensure compliance with ITS-P19-005: Acceptable Use of Open Source Software, where applicable. Additionally, SEs must maintain awareness of how the AI system uses personally identifiable, confidential, or sensitive information to ensure such use complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, notices, and policies. SEs are required to have SE leadership approval prior to adopting new AI systems. Such approval should include SE executive legal and operational leadership, including the SE's ethics officer. 4

The SE must identify an Information Owner for each AI system that meets the criteria set forth in Section 3.2. For examples of acceptable and unacceptable uses of AI systems, please see Appendix A to this policy.

## **4.2 Human Oversight**

AI systems aid and enhance human decision making that may impact the public. SEs must ensure that decisions that impact the public are not made without oversight by appropriate staff, who make the final decisions. Automated final decision systems are not permitted.

SEs shall take steps to ensure that where AI systems are used to aid in decision making that impacts the public, the outcomes, decisions, and supporting methodologies of such AI systems are documented appropriately. 5 The Information Owner is responsible for periodically assessing the outputs of their in-production AI systems to validate continuing reliability, safety, and fairness.

## **4.3 Fairness and Equity, and Explain Ability**

Use of AI systems should be fair and equitable in accordance with applicable State and Federal laws, rules, and regulations. Systemic, computational, and human biases should be identified and remediated.

All AI systems should be explainable to the maximum extent practicable.

## **4.4 Transparency**
