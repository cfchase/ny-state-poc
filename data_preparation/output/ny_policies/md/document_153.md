Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.

State Finance Law (SFL) ยง167 and ยง168 set forth the legal requirements for the transfer and disposal of State-owned personal property which has been determined to be no longer useful and may be surplused or disposed of by the State agencies having custody or control of such property excluding vehicles, which is determined by OGS.

## **3.0 Scope**

This policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, and interns. This policy applies to all New York State e-equipment and personal property owned and managed by ITS.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

It is the responsibility of each ITS business unit to understand and comply with this policy. When a business unit is in possession of ITS-owned personal property it no longer needs or uses, and it cannot be traded in to the manufacturer for credit toward purchasing a new item, either a Surplus/LDA Request must be entered into ITSM, or a CS-201 Form must be completed.

## **4.1 E-Equipment**

E-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers, printers, and data center equipment. The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO) guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA Service Request.
