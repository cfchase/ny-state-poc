Open Web Application Security Project ) The OWASP Top 10 is authored by OWASP, an open-source application security community project which aims to raise security awareness of web application security risks. Although OWASP is focused on web application security, the standards and controls presented by this organization are generally also applicable to non-web based information systems.

In addition to the "Top 10" list, OWASP also produces the Enterprise Security API (ESAPI) library and developer cheat sheets. The ESAPI library is an open source, web application security control library designed to mitigate risks to web applications. The ESAPI library provides a framework to implement code to address the risks listed within the OWASP Top Ten project. The cheat sheets provide a concise collection of high value information on specific web application security topics.

Additional information regarding OWASP, the ESAPI library and the Top Ten project is available at https://www.owasp.org/.

## **Common Weakness Enumeration**

The CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors publication is the result of collaboration between the SANS Institute, the MITRE Corporation, and many top software security experts in the US and Europe. The publication is a list of the most widespread and critical errors that can lead to serious vulnerabilities in software. They are often easy to find, and easy to exploit. They are dangerous because they will frequently allow attackers to completely take over the software, steal data, or prevent the software from working at all.

The MITRE Corporation website provides detailed guidance to software programmers for mitigating and avoiding each of the common weaknesses enumerated within the Top 25 list with the Common Weakness Enumeration List.
