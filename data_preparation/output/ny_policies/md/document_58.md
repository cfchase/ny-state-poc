## **4.0 Information Statement**

ITS Enterprise eDiscovery Services (EES) is a Business Unit within the Division of Legal Affairs (DLA) under the leadership of the Chief General Counsel. EES provides legal preservation services to ITS and Client Agencies for both email and non-email electronically stored information (ESI). To assist ITS and Client Agencies in meeting their legal preservation obligations, including those associated with investigations, litigation, administrative matters, and statutory requirements, EES has established legally defensible protocols around data collection, preservation, transfer, and destruction. To ensure ITS and Client Agencies are able to meet their legal obligations on this topic, it is imperative that all ITS business units consult with EES as outlined in this policy.

## **4.1 Mailbox Deprovisioning upon Employee, Contractor, or Consultant Separation**

This policy is intended to supplement the Inactive Mailbox Management Process, dated May 2016 and as amended April 2020, attached in Section 9 of this document.

After a state employee, contractor, or consultant leaves state service or transfers to another state agency, the user's mailbox will automatically begin the deprovisioning process and will be purged within 60 days of the separation date. This process will also automatically remove the user's email address from all associated distribution groups and the statewide Global Address List (GAL).

The deprovisioning process described above does not apply to email data that has been placed on a legal hold by a Client Agency's legal counsel, or their designee, through use of the electronic preservation mechanisms available through the ITSmanaged email system. If a Client Agency's legal counsel encounters issues with placing a legal hold on a user's mailbox, a request for support must be sent to the ITS EES team at its.sm.ees@its.ny.gov.
