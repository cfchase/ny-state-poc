Since these items of personal property were purchased with government funds, the law requires agencies to follow these procedures and the OGS guidelines to recoup their value by re-using the items or selling them to the public. Willful failure to follow these procedures and the OGS guidelines is a violation of law which may result in a charge of misconduct or other penalties. Your primary responsibility as an ITS employee is to notify ITS Facilities Services when you have an item of ITS personal property (i.e., eequipment, furniture, miscellaneous equipment, and vehicles) for which you no longer have a business need.

SFL ยง167 establishes OGS as the State agency responsible for transferring surplus equipment from one State department/agency to another State department/agency. Please refer to and review the OGS website for OGS current procedures and forms for the surplus of State property: https://ogs.ny.gov/state-surplus-property-program.
