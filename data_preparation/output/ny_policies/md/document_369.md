An honorarium is a payment offered in exchange for a professional service or activity, such as giving a speech, writing an article, or serving on a panel at a seminar or conference, that is not part of the ITS employee's official duties. An honorarium includes expenses incurred for travel, lodging, and meals related to the service performed.

## **4.6.3 Commission Regulations**

Commission regulations require prior approval or subsequent reporting for FDS Filers depending upon the nature and/or amount of the payment and the position of the individual receiving the payment. If an employee is offered air or ground travel reimbursement, or reimbursement for lodging or meals, to attend or speak at an event, then this invitation must be vetted with the Ethics Officer before acceptance.

## **4.7 Restrictions Concerning Acceptance of Gifts**

If an individual or entity offers an employee a gift in the course of the employee's employment, then that employee must contact the Ethics Officer to determine whether the gift may be accepted. This also applies when the gift is offered to the agency itself and presented to the ITS employee for acceptance.

A gift is anything of more than nominal value (fair market value exceeding $15.00) and includes, but is not limited to: money, service, loan, travel, lodging, meals, refreshments, entertainment, discount, forbearance of an obligation, or a promise that has monetary value. Employees may not solicit or accept gifts except under certain circumstances. Generally, food and drink offered to all participants at an event or small promotional items (such as pens or notebooks) are not considered gifts.

A gift that cannot be accepted also cannot be redirected to another, i.e., it may not be donated or given away to a third party (such as to a spouse, parent, sibling, child, relative, friend, or charity). Additionally, spouses and minor/un-emancipated children of employees cannot solicit, accept, or receive gifts from registered lobbyists.
