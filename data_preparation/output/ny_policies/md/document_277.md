The Universal Navigation is designed to extend the entire width of the webpage. Unless a specific exclusion is made based on a written request, the Universal Navigation should extend to the full width, with no space between the respective elements and the corresponding edges of the browser or application window. The elements use responsive design techniques to appropriately scale for different devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones (provided the site or application was also designed in a responsive manner).

## **4.3 Universal Navigation Color**

The Universal Navigation is designed to blend with NYS sites and applications; hence colors of the Universal Navigation are not to be adjusted. Colors on existing web sites should continue to follow the established NYS Branding Guidelines.

## **4.4 Placement of the Universal Navigation**

The Universal Navigation must appear at the top of every page on the SE's public web sites and web applications. Nothing should appear above the Universal Navigation in the browser or application window except NYS translation functionality. No additional edits should be made to alter the appearance of the Universal Navigation, including additional links. No elements of the native web page or application should overlap the container element of the Universal Navigation.

## **4.5 Intranet and Non-Public Facing Sites or Applications**

If inclusion enhances the user experience, Intranet web sites, extranets, and other nonpublic facing sites or applications may include the Universal Navigation but are not required to do so.

## **4.6 Functionality and Updates to the Universal Navigation**

Functionality of the Universal Navigation should be tested in a development environment before deploying. If problems exist when implementing the standard version, check in the repository for additional authorized versions that can be used until problems are resolved.

Updates to the Universal Navigation occur periodically. In general, a testing period will precede official deployment of updates. Test the updates in development environments and submit problems or concerns through the ITS Enterprise Information Technology Management System's ("ITSM") WebNY Enterprise Platform Services Bureau assignment group, L2 PLAT WEBNY SUPPORT.
