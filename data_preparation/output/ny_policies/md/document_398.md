Users deemed by their agency to require the use of State-issued mobile devices to perform their job duties pursuant to an approved Mobile Device Plan will be provided the necessary devices, in accordance with the Best Practices set forth in Appendix B of this Policy. Issuance of any mobile device must be in accordance with the Client Agency's approved Mobile Device Plan. ITS recommends that Client Agency users are limited to a maximum of one data plan per user. The Client Agency's Mobile Device Plan must justify all exceptions to this limitation for each individual user. It is the

responsibility of the Client Agency to properly onboard users for mobile device usage by completing and submitting either an Employee Onboarding request or Mobile Device request through the ITSM Service Catalog. ITS Workplace Services (WPS) will then fulfill the request in accordance with this Policy.

## **Biannual Mobile Usage Report**

To aid in management of mobile technology usage, ITS will provide Client Agencies with biannual reports identifying all the agency's mobile devices by device type with assigned user and device activity levels. Timing of biannual reports will coincide with the ITS quarterly billing cycle and invoices.

ITS will also include recommendations in these biannual reports for changes to existing or future mobile technology deployments within the Client Agency to ensure the appropriate use of State resources. For example, ITS may recommend conversion of smartphone devices with no data usage to voice-only devices, elimination of inactive lines with no voice or data usage or tethering of devices. These biannual reports will also identify users with more than one data plan for examination by the agency.

The Client Agency must either accept or reject (with explanation) the recommendations in a biannual report within 30 calendar days of issuance. This response should be provided to the ITS Mobile Device Team at its.sm.enterprisemobility@its.ny.gov. Failure to respond to a biannual report within 30 calendar days of issuance constitutes acceptance of the report by the Client Agency, including acceptance of any resulting action taken by ITS consistent with this policy.
