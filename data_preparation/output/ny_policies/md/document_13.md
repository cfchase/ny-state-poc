# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

This policy establishes a framework for issuing and managing trusted identity credentials to allow citizens, businesses, and government employees to conduct business through New York State (NYS) information systems. A trusted identity credential is one in which a State Entity (SE) has sufficient confidence that the identity credential represents the person named in it and that the person engaged in the electronic transaction is the person to whom the identity credential was issued.

This policy benefits users of systems and e-Government services by providing a framework that creates and issues NYS electronic identity credentials that can be universally trusted by ensuring alignment with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital identity guidelines. SEs will be able to participate in shared identity solutions and reduce the need to issue and manage their own electronic identity infrastructure for e-Government services; resulting in reduced costs of providing online services that require user authentication.

## **2.0 Authority**

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 ,
