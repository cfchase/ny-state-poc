There is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between security activities and SSDLC phases. Security activities often need to be performed iteratively as a project progresses or cycles through the SSDLC. Unless stated otherwise, the placement of security activities within the SSDLC may vary in accordance with the SSDLC being utilized and the security needs of the application or system. Appendix A: Security Activities within the SDLC provides a sample correlation of security activities to a generic SDLC. Appendix B: Description of Security Activities provides a description of the above security considerations and activities.
