employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

An exception may be granted by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of ITS, or their designee, for non-compliance with a policy or standard. Justification for approval of policy or standard exceptions include, but are not limited to:

· Implementation of a solution with equivalent protection to the requirements in the CISO policy or standard.

· Implementation of a solution with superior protection to the requirements in the CISO policy or standard.

· Impending retirement of a system.

· Inability to implement the policy or standard due to some limitation (e.g., technical constraint, business limitation or statutory requirement).

Exceptions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and their approval is not automatic. Exceptions that are granted will be for a specific period of time. Upon expiration of the exception, an extension of the exception may be requested, if it is still required.

The exception request must be submitted on a completed Exception Request Form and must include:

· Description of the non-compliance

· Anticipated length of non-compliance

· Proposed assessment of risk associated with non-compliance

· Proposed compensating controls for managing the risk associated with non- compliance

· Proposed corrective action plan or mitigation plan

· Proposed review date to evaluate progress toward compliance

· The Exception Request Form must be signed by the following:

o Information/Business Owner

o Information Security Officer (ISO)/Designated Security Representative

o Chief Information Officer (CIO): (Agency/Portfolio CIO)

Commissioner/Executive Deputy Commissioner (or equivalent) If the non-compliance with the security policy or standard is due to a superior solution, an exception is still required. Such instances will be evaluated for possible inclusion into published policy or standard.
