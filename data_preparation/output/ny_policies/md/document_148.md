## **Appendix B: Description of Security Activities**

## **1. Classify Information and Establish System Criticality**

As per the NYS-P03-002: Information Security Policy, all information contained within, manipulated by, or passing through a system or application must be classified by the SE. Classification must reflect the importance of the information's confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as per the NYS-S14-002: Information Classification Standard. This will help determine minimum security controls, along with any legal and/or regulatory compliance domains.

The criticality of the system must be established and documented by the SE. The criticality level must reflect the business value of the function provided by the system and the potential business damage that might result from a loss of this functionality.
