# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The purpose of this standard is to establish controls for 802.11 wireless networks in order to minimize risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of State Entity's (SE) information and to support secure access to such information and State Information Technology Resources and services over SE wireless networks.

**802**11 wireless networks enable users of wireless devices the flexibility to physically move throughout a wireless environment while maintaining connectivity to the network. While 802.11 wireless networks are exposed to many of the same risks as wired networks, they are also exposed to additional risks unique to wireless technologies. This standard outlines the additional controls required for the use of wireless networks by SEs.
