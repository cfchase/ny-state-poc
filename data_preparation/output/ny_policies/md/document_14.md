issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## **3.0 Scope**

This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy and an SE's policy, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

This policy requires that SE information owners complete digital identity requirements assessments during system design to determine the appropriate Identity Assurance Level (IAL), Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL), and Federation Assurance Level (FAL) for all Information Technology (IT) systems that will require user authentication and contain or process SE data. The assessments focus on:

o Identity Assurance

 whether the individual seeking to access the system is who they claim to be and the potential impact to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the data and/or system if that individual is not who they claim to be;

o Authentication Assurance

 whether the individual accessing the service today is the same individual who accessed the service using the same authenticator previously; and

o Federation Assurance

 The strength and manner in which the results of authentication processes and relevant identity information is conveyed between applications.

NYS-P20-001 Page 2 of 14 Completion of the assessments provides a system specific numerical IAL, AAL, and FAL.

Assessments must be documented and kept with other system documentation and must be used to guide system design and functions which impact identity, authentication, and/or federation services.

All digital identity assurance processes will be managed using the NYS-S20-001 Digital Identity Standard.

## **4.1 Identity Proofing**

Identity proofing is the process used to verify an individual's association with their realworld identity. See Appendix A for a visualization of the process.

The system's IAL defines the degree of confidence that the individual's claimed identity is their real identity. The level of certainty in the identity of an individual is established through the strength of the evidence and processes used to verify the identity of the individual requesting a trusted identity credential.
