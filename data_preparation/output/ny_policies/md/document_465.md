A telecommuter is required to report to their official work site upon their supervisor's request at any time. A telecommuter may request to charge leave accruals in lieu of returning to the official work site. Such requests will be reviewed in accordance with all normal standards governing use of leave accruals. When the supervisor requires telecommuters to report to the official work site on a scheduled telecommuting day, there is no expectation that the telecommuter will be granted a substitute telecommuting day in return. However, with flexibility as a key component of the program, at the discretion of the supervisor, a telecommuter may change a scheduled telecommuting day within the same pay period. If a telecommuter is required to report to their official work site, they will not be reimbursed for travel.

Telecommuters must be available via all required methods of communication throughout the workday. The telecommuter must comply with all applicable ITS and NYS policies and standards while telecommuting including, but not limited to NYS-P14-001 Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources and ITSS23-002 Use of Personal Devices and Communication Channels.

Unless otherwise directed by ITS, telecommuters will not be excused from work when a directed early departure or office closure is issued for the official work site.

Conversely, if an emergency occurs at the alternate work site and the telecommuter is unable to work at the telecommuting site that day or if the telecommuter is unable to, for any reason, continue working during the scheduled hours, the supervisor may direct the telecommuter to report to the officialwork site or grant appropriate charge to leave accruals.

## **4.6.1.1 Exceptions**

Exceptions to the 50% telecommuting schedule may be allowed on a temporary and ad-hoc basis with the approval of the supervisor and second level supervisor within a single pay period. Employees are encouraged to contact Human Resources to utilize other available benefits (outlined above) if an exception is needed beyond a single pay period.
