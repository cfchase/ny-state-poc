Upon receipt of the results of the review and/or disposition from ITS, the requesting SE is required to resubmit the PTP request to reflect the review comments with the final solicitation documents. This step is necessary to obtain a final ITS PTP approval.

During the review, ITS may refer the PTP request to a detailed review process track to better understand the effort, or specific technology components of the IT Purchase. ITS will convene a meeting with the SE to conduct a detailed review of the PTP. Also, DOB and any other relevant stakeholders deemed appropriate by ITS may participate in these meetings pursuant to DOB Budget Bulletin H-300.

## **4.1.3 Disposition**

All dispositions will be provided to the requesting SE via the ASCA system. Approved PTP requests will continue on through DOB's B-1184 review process.

Please note SEs must submit the final PTP approval form along with other required documentation to OSC. OSC will not approve any purchase request without a PTP

approval from ITS. If a PTP is denied, the SE can appeal or request an exception by resubmitting the request with supporting documents and a brief explanation.

## **4.2 Processing Time**

In order to complete a thorough and timely review of PTP requests, ITS will make every effort to meet the following PTP processing targets:

· Standard processing time is 15 business days from the time of submission.

· Large or technically complex IT Purchases processing time is 30 business days from the time of submission, or within reason.

Timeframes are contingent upon, and do not begin to run until the SE submits all necessary details and information required for a decision.
