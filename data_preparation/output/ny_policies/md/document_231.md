**c** Facilities shall review utilization on a monthly basis and may redeploy/swap out if State Vehicles are found to be underutilized. Such vehicles may be swapped within a business unit or to another business unit.

## **2. Replacement**

**a** The Division Executive, or the Executive's designee, to which a State Vehicle is assigned, in consultation with Facilities will, on an ongoing basis, evaluate the most economical time to replace State Vehicles. In addition to fiscal considerations, factors to be used in evaluating replacement vehicles will include vehicle age, accumulated mileage, condition, maintenance/cost history and programmatic need. The age/mileage criteria to be used are vehicles that are at least seven years old or have at least 125,000 miles.

**b** Exceptions to these criteria may be considered. State Vehicle disposal may be reviewed at an earlier point if the performance of the vehicle does not meet the needs of the Business Unit and/or due to an excessive vehicle maintenance or repair history in relation to the vehicle value and other possible lower cost alternatives. State Vehicles may be maintained beyond the replacement requirements if deemed safe and economical to operate and the vehicle does not incur excessive ongoing maintenance or repair operating costs.

## **3. Surplus**

When it is determined a State Vehicle should be removed from service pursuant to ITS-P04-005 Surplus and Disposal of ITS Equipment, Furniture and Vehicles policy. The following steps must be taken:

**a** All decals, etc., except for inspection sticker, must be removed and the vehicle cleaned inside and out.

**b** The State Vehicle is to be transported to the Swan Street location if the normal assigned parking for that vehicle is not in Albany/Capital District.

**c** When the State Vehicle is turned in to Facilities, all related items such as gas cards, Fleet Service cards/manuals, E-Z Pass tags, and completed/signed mileage reports must also be turned in.
