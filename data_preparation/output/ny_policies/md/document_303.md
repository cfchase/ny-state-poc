**a** Information security requires both an information risk management function (including cyber-related risk management) and an information technology security function. Depending on the structure of the SE, an individual or group can serve in both roles or a separate individual or group can be designated for each role. It is

recommended that these functions be performed by a high-level executive or a group that includes high level executives.

**1** Each SE must designate an individual or group to be responsible for the risk management function. For the purposes of clarity and readability, this policy will refer to the individual, or group, so designated as the Cyber Risk Coordinator (CRC) ( see Exhibit 1 for a more detailed description of the role). The CRC is responsible for ensuring that:

**i** risk-related considerations for information assets and individual information systems, including authorization decisions, are viewed from the perspective of the SE as an enterprise regarding the overall strategic goals and objectives of the SE in carrying out its core missions and business functions; and

**ii** the management of information assets, information system-related security risks, and other cyber-security risks is consistent across the SE, reflects the risk tolerance of the SE, and is considered along with other types of risks to ensure mission/business success.

**2** Each SE must designate an individual or group to be responsible for the technical information security function. For purposes of clarity and readability, this policy will refer to the individual, or group, designated as the Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative. This function will be responsible for evaluating and advising on information security risks. For SEs that receive IT services as a member of one of the portfolios within ITS, the information security function may be fulfilled by the Chief Information Security Office (CISO) and Security Services Teams.

**b** Information security risk decisions must be made through consultation with both function areas described in a. above.

**c** Although the technical information security function may be outsourced to third parties, each SE retains overall responsibility for the security of the information that it owns. The function of the CRC must be performed within the SE.
