Telecommuters are also responsible for protecting state data and information from unauthorized disclosure and to safeguard files, documents, and equipment at all times. Security incidents, including actual or suspected security compromises, must be immediately reported to the telecommuter's supervisor and the telecommuter must abide by and follow the procedures outlined in ITS' Cyber Incident Reporting Procedures. A compromise of information security, including the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or the personally identifiable information of ITS staff or customers/clients, which occurred due to the telecommuter's neglect or violation of applicable ITS or state policy, will be addressed through appropriate administrative action.

Under no circumstance may ITS data or information be transferred to or stored on any personal devices. Telecommuters cannot allow an ITS issued device to be used by any other person not otherwise authorized to use the device for the purposes of conducting official state business. Telecommuters must log off and secure any computer being utilized to conduct official state business when not in use.

Telecommuters must also take the following specific precautions:

**2** Do not transmit confidential or other information from work e-mail to personal e-mail addresses (e.g., aol.com, yahoo.com or gmail.com).

**1** Only take confidential information offsite when authorized in advance by their supervisor.

**3** Securely store all records and information so that others cannot access it.

**5** Place documents requiring destruction in ITS Confidential/Sensitive destruction bins located at the official work site.
