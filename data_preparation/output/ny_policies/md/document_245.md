In accordance with the DOJ Rule, SEs are to ensure that all web content and mobile applications, regardless of creation date unless specifically exempted, are accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. The DOJ Rule requires compliance with WCAG Version 2.1, Level AA. The terms "web content" and "mobile applications" are defined in the rule.

## **4.1.1 Exceptions to the DOJ Rule**

The DOJ Rule includes limited exceptions for web content and mobile application compliance with WCAG Version 2.1. The following is more fully described in the DOJ Rule available at 28 CFR Part 35:

· Archived web content;

· Content posted by a third party;

Preexisting conventional electronic documents unless those documents are used to apply for, gain access to, or participate in a public entity's services, programs, or activities;

Individualized, password-protected or otherwise secured conventional electronic documents; and

· Preexisting social media posts

## **4.2 STL Requirements**

STL Section 103-d requires that newly launched state agency websites, as well as those undergoing significant "changes to form or function," conform to WCAG Version 2.2, Level AA, to the extent practicable.

STL Section 103-d defines "changes to form or function" as "…modifications to the visual presentation, informational organization, website infrastructure, or other user utility of the website, including but not limited to: 1. redesigns of the site layout, color schemes, graphics, branding elements, or other aesthetic components; and 2. integration of dynamic interfaces." Websites developed or managed through a thirdparty contract on behalf of an SE must also meet WCAG Version 2.2 AA conformance criteria. Detailed guidelines for achieving accessibility consistent with WCAG Version 2.2 AA are available on the W3C website at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/, which includes comprehensive support documentation under the section "WCAG 2.2 Supporting Documents."
