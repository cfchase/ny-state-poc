If a device is potentially compromised, the user or other custodian must notify the agency's Chief Legal Counsel to arrange return. It is the responsibility of the Client Agency to attempt recovery of the device and notify ITS to arrange return to ITS. ITS will confirm data encryption and update the statewide inventory, noting the device's status. A compromised device is a device that was left outside of the care of the assigned user due to the death, incarceration, or other unusual circumstance leaving the user unable to return the device.

## **$^{ }$4.5 Device Management**

Devices issued to custodians must be managed by using an ITS designated configuration management solution and joined to a designated directory service.

Issued devices are expected to be in active use. Devices which are powered down, disconnected from networks, or otherwise isolated from ITS management services for extended periods of time must be recorded as lost by the custodian, unless appropriate arrangements are made for storage when not in use.

## **4.6 Deprovisioning Computing Devices**

ITS is responsible for maintaining an accurate inventory of available and allocated computing devices. This inventory enables ITS to provide the necessary computing devices to Client Agencies - ensuring that agency users have the tools they need to properly serve the citizens and businesses of New York State.

It is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly offboard its users upon separation from the agency, to return/replace devices no longer needed, and to coordinate with the agency's Chief Legal Counsel regarding preservation obligations before proceeding with deprovisioning requests to ITS. Whether the user leaves state service or simply

transfers to a new agency, the Client Agency must promptly complete and submit an Employee Offboarding request through the ITSM Service Catalog which provides ITS Workplace Services (WPS) the necessary information to reclaim and re-allocate the computing device.
