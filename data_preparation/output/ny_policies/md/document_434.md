## **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards**

The PCI DSS requirements are developed and maintained by an industry standards body called the PCI Security Standards Council (SSC). The standards are enforced by the five payment card brands: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, JCB International and Discover. Each brand provides its own compliance guidelines, reporting and validation requirements, deadlines, brand-specific definitions and penalties for noncompliance. Service providers should therefore obtain notice and reporting requirements directly from the individual card brands.
