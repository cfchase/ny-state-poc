· This involves the review of anomalies to determine whether an incident has occurred, and, if one has occurred, determining the nature of the incident. Detection begins with an event, an anomaly that has been reported or noticed in a system or network. Detection can be accomplished through technical sources (e.g., operations staff, anti-virus software), non-technical sources (e.g., user security awareness and reporting), or both. It is important to recognize that not every network or system event will be a security incident. In fact, most events will not lead to security incidents. For that reason, a Cyber First Responder must be assigned to determine if there is an incident, categorize the incident, and escalate as necessary.

**3** Collect and Preserve Data

· Collect and preserve data for incident verification, categorization, prioritization, mitigation, reporting, and attribution.

· Incidents must be classified and escalated as soon as possible to the proper IR stakeholders to promote collaboration and information sharing.

**4** Perform Technical Analysis

· The goal of this analysis is to examine the breadth of data sources throughout the environment to discover at least some part of an attack chain, if not all of it. As information evolves and the investigation progresses, update the scope to incorporate new information.

**5** Correlate Events and Document Timeline

· Acquire, store, and analyze logs to correlate adversarial activity.

**6** Identify Anomalous Activity

· Assess and profile affected systems and networks for subtle activity that might be adversary behavior.

**7** Identify Root Cause and Enabling Conditions

· Identifying the root cause will help inform triage and post-incident activities.

**8** Gather Incident Indicators

· Will allow for correlative analysis that can provide insight into the capabilities of the adversary.

**9** Analyze for Common Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

· TTPs describe "why," "what," and "how." Tactics describe the technical
