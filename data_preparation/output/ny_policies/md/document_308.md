**g** Merging of information which creates a new information asset or situations that create the potential for merging (e.g., backup tape with multiple files) must be evaluated to determine if a new classification of the merged data is warranted.

**h** All reproductions of information in its entirety must carry the same confidentiality classification as the original. Partial reproductions need to be evaluated to determine if a new classification is warranted.

**i** Each classification has an approved set of baseline controls designed to protect the data asset and is aligned with NIST 800-53B Control Baselines for Information

Systems and Organizations. These controls must be evaluated, tailored, and implemented to meet business requirements.

**j** The SE must communicate the requirements for secure handling of information to its workforce.

**k** A written or electronic inventory of all SE information assets must be maintained by the SE.

Associated Standards: NYS-S14-002, Information Classification Standard; NYS-S13003, Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard;

## **4.6 Information Sharing**

**a** SE content made available to the general public must be reviewed according to a process to be defined and approved by the SE. The process must include the review and approval of updates to publicly available content and must consider the type and classification of information posted.

**b** PPSI must not be made available without appropriate safeguards approved by the SE.

**c** For non-public information to be released outside a SE or shared between SEs, a process must be established that, at a minimum:

**1** ensures that an information classification has been performed and documented for the information to be released or shared;

**2** documents the intended use of the information;

**3** identifies the responsibilities of each party for protecting the information;

**4** defines the process and minimum controls required to transmit, store, and use the information;

**5** records the measures that each party has in place to protect the information;

**6** defines a method for compliance measurement;
