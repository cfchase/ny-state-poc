## **4.0 Information Statement**

## **Appropriate Use of Agency Development**

**2** In addition to the application user base, Client Agencies cannot develop applications when any of the following criteria apply:

**1** Client Agencies may develop or create their own business applications when the target user base is an individual or a single business unit. Applications with a user scope of entire departments or inter-department processes must be built and maintained by ITS or procured through a third-party following appropriate procurement protocol including NYS-P08-001 - Plan to Procure .

**a** Business processes are being implemented beyond personal or workgroup productivity.

**c** The application requires the use of a privileged account.

**b** The use case requires a new data integration from an existing ITS managed system.

**d** The data persisted or transmitted by the application has a data confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) impact of Moderate or High.

**f** There are some platforms where these prohibitive criteria do not apply. See Section 4.4 for more details.

**e** The application exposes or ingests information to or from external users.

## **4.1 Applicability of Information Security Requirements**

All applications and components created or developed independently by a ClientAgency are subject to all NYS Information Security policies and standards. Client Agencies must consult with their assigned information security representative in the ITS Chief Information Security Office prior to developing each application to ensure the appropriate security requirements have been addressed.

## **4.2 Agency Development Support**

ITS is responsible for maintaining the operation of platforms that enable Client Agency application development activities. Client agency development is only permitted on ITS supported platforms. The Client Agency is solely responsible for any applications or components created through their own development efforts. ITS will not support applications developed by non-ITS personnel unless the intellectual property of the application is transferred to ITS, and the application is completely onboarded through the ITS Demand process.
