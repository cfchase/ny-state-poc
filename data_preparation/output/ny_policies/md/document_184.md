Example(s): Information that must be lawfully made available to the general public from Federal, State, or local government records or information that does not need to be withheld for security, legal or privacy concerns is generally deemed publicly available. Examples include public transportation schedules, a listing of local city events, or health improvement guidelines. These items would be ranked low in confidentiality.

[2] Does the information include or contain PPSI (Personal, Private, or Sensitive Information)?

Example(s): A W-2 form contains a name, as well as a social security number. This would be considered private information and therefore have a minimum confidentiality ranking of moderate, which may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent impact questions. See the NYS Information Technology Policies, Standards and Best Practice Guidelines Glossary for a definition of PPSI.

[3] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on health and personal safety?

Example(s): There may be information which, if publicly released, may impact the health and personal safety of the State Entity's workforce and NYS citizens such as, the blueprint and drawings of critical infrastructure buildings, critical infrastructure related systems, network configurations, or disaster recovery/business continuity plans. These could be exploited by criminals to sabotage or destroy buildings, emergency services, or critical infrastructure operations resulting in a severe impact to health and personal safety of NYS citizens thereby placing these items in the high confidentiality category.

[4] What is the financial or agency liability impact of unauthorized disclosure of information?

Example(s): The State Entity may be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines due to disclosure of information protected by law or confidentiality agreements. For instance, unauthorized release of vendor bid information containing bidder's proprietary information could jeopardize the bidding process as well as potentially expose the State to litigation.

Similarly, if the investment decisions of the State's retirement system become known prior to their execution, it could alter the market sentiment ahead of the investment causing financial losses.
