| Location of Observed Activity : Where the observed activity was detected in the network. | 5 LEVEL 1 - BUSINESS DEMILITERIZED ZONE  - Activity was observed in the business network's  demilitarized zone (DMZ)  LEVEL 2 - BUSINESS NETWORK  - Activity was observed in the business or corporate network of the victim. These systems would be corporate user workstations, application servers, and other non-  core management systems.  LEVEL 3 - BUSINESS NETWORK MANAGEMENT  -  Activity was observed in business network |

These systems may be internally facing services such  as SharePoint sites, financial systems, or relay "jump"  boxes into more critical systems.  LEVEL 5 - CRITICAL SYSTEM MANAGEMENT  - Activity was observed in high-level critical systems                                            |
