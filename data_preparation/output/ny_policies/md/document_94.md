路 In consultation with their ISO/designated security representative, or their designee, the SE must develop IR standard operating procedures (SOPs) that reflect industry standards and best practices. SEs must also ensure that the SOPs are followed during IR. The SE must routinely vet and validate the tools and techniques used for IR. To operate efficiently and effectively, the IR process must be regularly tested. This testing must occur at least annually . This testing can be accomplished with mock incident training or tabletop exercises using realistic scenarios to provide a high-level outline and systematic walkthrough of the IR process and, to the extent possible, must include all IR stakeholders. These training scenarios must include specific "discussion points" that represent key learning opportunities, and incorporate lessons-learned, which can then be integrated into the IR process as part of its review.

**3** Instrumentation

路 Develop and maintain an accurate picture of infrastructure through technology such as anti-virus, end point detection monitoring, data loss prevention, intrusion detection, and log management.

**4** Communications and Logistics

路 SEs must assign responsibility toa central point of contact who will coordinate identification and reporting out to the appropriate stakeholders. Typically, this is performed by the SE's ISO/designated security representative, or their designee. All employees are required to report suspected information security incidents or weaknesses to the appropriate manager and ISO/designated security representative, or their designee.

## **4.2.2 Detection & Analysis**

Detection & Analysis is often the most challenging aspect of the IR process. It involves monitoring networks, systems, and data to identify a potential cybersecurity incident and examining the detected incident to determine its scope, impact, and root cause so that an effective response can be undertaken.

## **Activities**

**1** Declare Incident

路 This involves the review of anomalies to determine whether an incident has occurred, and, if one has occurred, determining the nature of the incident.

**2** Determine Investigation Scope
