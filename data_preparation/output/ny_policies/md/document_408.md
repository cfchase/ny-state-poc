# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The New York State Office of Information Technology Services ("ITS") plays a key role in the exchange, transfer, receipt, storage, and processing of electronic information and data for its Client Agencies. ITS's Client Agencies are subject to a myriad of statutory and regulatory compliance requirements including IRS Publication 1075, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Privacy Act, and the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy. Often, the compliance requirements established by these statutory and regulatory frameworks are passed down to ITS's Client Agencies through data sharing or computer matching agreements. In other cases, the receipt of federal financial participation is conditioned upon adhering to such requirements. As a result, ITS is asked to provide technical reviews of our systems for alignment with these compliance requirements and/or execute agreements with our Client Agencies. This Policy is to establish a support model for ITS when Client Agencies request ITS support for the review and execution of data sharing or computer matching agreements.
