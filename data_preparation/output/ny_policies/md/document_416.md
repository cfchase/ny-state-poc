This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 1171, issued January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law including their employees, and all third parties (e.g., local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors), that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

This standard covers all mobile devices managed by the State or which are used by the State workforce to store SE information.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

Mobile devices are computing devices in a small form factor that have at least one network connection interface, non-removable and/or removable storage, and are portable. These devices come in many forms and names including smartphones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), tablets, laptops, smartwatches, and wearable devices. Mobile devices must follow all requirements of the NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy and the following:

**1** As required by the NYS-S14-007 Encryption Standard, all mobile devices that access or contain any SE information must be encrypted.

**2** For State-issued mobile devices or personal mobile devices with direct access to SE private networks ( see NYS-S14-012 Bring Your Own Device Standard), only those applications which are approved by the SE may be installed and/or run on the mobile devices. Controls must be in place to both enforce SE application control requirements and prevent the installation of unauthorized or prohibited applications. Applications accessing SE data must be delivered either through the platform vendor's AppStore or State-authorized management systems.

**3** SE information must be removed or rendered inaccessible from mobile devices after no more than 10 incorrect authentication attempts.

**4** Mobile devices must automatically lock after being idle for a period not to exceed 10 minutes.
