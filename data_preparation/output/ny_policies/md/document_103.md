## **Appendix C - Impact Categories**

$^{ }$The table below defines each impact category description and its associated severity levels. Use the tables below to identify impact levels and incident details. Note: Incidents may affect multiple types of data; therefore, SEs may select multiple options when identifying the information impact. This table is taken from US-CERT Federal Incident Notification Guidelines.
