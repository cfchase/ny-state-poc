Virtual Desktop Printing will be delivered using a software-based service that securely transports data through the encrypted Virtual Desktop session before forwarding to locally attached or networked printers.

## **4.2 User Identity and Access Services**

LDSS employees accessing State systems must use individual State-provided credentials in State-managed identity systems, consistent with applicable security policies. Shared credentials are not permitted.

Privileged or administrator access to State systems, including managed desktops or servers on the State network, require that LDSS employees agree to undergo fingerprintbased background checks and submit to annual compliance training. The State will bear the cost of fingerprinting. The LDSS must ensure that staff complete training mandated by OTDA, OCFS, DOH, or any other applicable government agency, as necessary to comply with requirements for access to regulated data.

All privileged access will be facilitated by a State privileged access management system.

## **4.3 Endpoint Devices**

Individual LDSSs are responsible for providing their employees with appropriate endpoint devices to access State applications using Virtual Desktops. As the existing devices were procured with non-State funds, ownership of existing endpoint devices will be assumed by each respective LDSS.

## **4.3.1 Device Maintenance and Support**

Active legacy devices on the State's inventory list as maintained by the State will continue to be maintained by the State through their service lifecycle, but not later than January 10, 2023. Devices determined to require maintenance will be replaced by new or refurbished equipment. These replacement devices may include manufacturers warranties but will not include additional maintenance provided by the State and the devices will not be added to the State's inventory list.

Devices provided to facilitate remote work and utilization of Virtual Desktop technology will not be added to the State's inventory list. These devices include manufacturer warranties. The State will not provide maintenance or support services and ownership of the devices will devolve to the counties.

## **4.3.2 High Speed Printers**
