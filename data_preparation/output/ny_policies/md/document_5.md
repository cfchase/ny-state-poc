This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any Information Technology (IT) Resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy and an SE's policy, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

Non-SEs, including authorities, boards, and other New York State governmental organizations are strongly encouraged to adopt this policy or use this policy for guidanc e or as a model.

## **3.2 Definitions and Covered Use**

This policy applies to all technology systems that deploy AI technology, hereafter referred to as "AI systems." For the purposes of this policy, AI is defined as a machinebased system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.

The definition includes but is not limited to systems that use machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, and computer vision technologies, including generative AI. 2 The definition does not include basic calculations, basic automation, or pre-recorded "if this then that (IFTT)" response systems.

This policy applies to all new and existing AI systems that are developed, used or procured by SEs, that when used could directly impact the public. 3

The policy does not govern SE's regulatory or other actions regarding non-agency uses of AI.
