Example(s): Some information generated within a State Entity is for internal use only and is not meant to be disclosed externally. The confidentiality of such information varies considerably based on the information asset. Information, such as system security configurations, which, if released, could jeopardize the security of a State Entity's assets, would require high confidentiality controls.

Administrative information, such as procedures for travel approval, though not publicized outside the State Entity, would be information that the public could legitimately obtain and should be ranked as low in confidentiality.

## **Integrity Questions**

[1] Does the information include medical records?

Example(s): In the case of a health care institution, it is important that medical records and medical history are accurate. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is allergic to specific medications so that they are not administered. In addition, it would be necessary to know whether a person has a particular illness or medical condition which would require special treatment. Malicious or accidental alteration of a patient's health records can cause serious health consequences for that individual. Medical records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate. This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions.

[2] Is the information relied upon to make critical security decisions?

Example(s): It is important that security records (e.g., computer security logs, building security access logs) are accurate in order to verify legitimate access and identify unauthorized access attempts. Security related records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate. This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions.

[3] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on health and safety?

Example(s): There is a potential for severe impact on the safety of citizens if someone accesses an airline system and modifies the onboard navigation system.

The removal or editing of surveillance tapes may have a serious or severe impact depending on the presence of additional information provided by other forms of surveillance.

Something that could be of low to no impact on health and safety would be the unauthorized modification of an employee's calendars.
