Generally, an outside activity with an ITS vendor creates the presumption of a conflict of interest, the appearance of a conflict of interest, or the appearance of impropriety. Factors that rebut that presumption include the nature of the requestor's ITS responsibilities and work duties, the nature of the outside activity work, and the manner by which the requestor would be compensated (i.e., revenue sharing with an ITS Vendor is not permitted).

Additional Commission regulations apply to certain employees, including policymakers, with respect to outside activities or employment. Additional regulations also apply for Political Activities (see Section 4.5 ).

## **4.5 Restrictions Concerning Political Activities**

ITS employees interested in becoming prospective candidates for an election, participating in a campaign, or engaging in fundraising activities for political candidates must seek guidance from the Ethics Officer before proceeding.

## **4.5.1 Candidates**

ITS employees that do become prospective candidates are prohibited from : (1) using any ITS resources or personnel to aid in their campaign; (2) campaigning or soliciting/accepting contributions toward their candidacy during work hours or at the

worksite/ITS facilities; (3) soliciting or accepting any contributions from individuals or entities that do business with ITS; (4) using their government position to gain any special advantage; or (5) indicating in any way that ITS endorses them in their candidacy. In addition, employees may be required to comply with certain Federal restrictions.
