A defined business need associated with an objective that supports Critical Incident response.

The recipient of a request will route it to applicable Portfolio Executive Directors for review, coordination, and approval.

If a Portfolio Executive Director can execute a request utilizing existing tools, technologies, licenses, and resources, then they can approve or disapprove the request following consultation with the Chief Technology Officer, Chief Information Security Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. Requests for such applications and enhancements must use technologies that are currently supported by ITS. Application architecture for such applications must be explicitly approved by the Chief Technology Officer or a designee.

If a Portfolio Executive Director cannot execute a request within their own team, then the request will be escalated to the State CIO and Executive Deputy CIO for review. In these cases, meetings may be required to discuss across ITS Divisions. Escalated request decisions will be communicated across the ITS Leadership Team utilizing the its.dl.executive.team distribution list.
