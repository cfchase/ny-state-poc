third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different guideline, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

For purposes of this guideline, "State Entities" shall include state agencies as defined in the Internet Security and Privacy Act, which is taken from the Personal Privacy Protection Law ("PPPL").

The term 'state agency website' refers to an internet website operated by or for a state agency, including those websites operated on behalf of a state agency by other public or private entities, but does not include any portions of the internet outside of the control of the state agency.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

## **4.1 Introduction**

The ISPA requires each SE that maintains a website to adopt and post an Internet privacy policy. This requirement reflects the recognition that citizens and businesses must be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit State Agency Websites. Pursuant to section 203(1) of the STL, ITS has specified a model Internet privacy policy for use by SEs.

This guideline highlights a number of considerations that should be taken into account in drafting an Internet privacy policy and provides an outline for the contents of an Internet privacy policy. This guideline may be used by each SE, in conjunction with the ISPA and ITS' model policy, to draft Internet privacy policies that accurately describe the practices and procedures relating to the information they collect about users through the State Agency Website and to the SE's retention and disclosure of that information.

The attached model Internet privacy policy was drafted using this guideline. This model is not intended to reflect the actual practices and procedures of any particular SE and should not be adopted by any SE without an analysis of whether the example accurately describes the SE's practices and procedures.
