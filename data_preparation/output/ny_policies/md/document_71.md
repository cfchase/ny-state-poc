Hashing algorithms can be used for multiple purposes including, but not limited to, digital signatures, message authentication codes, key derivation functions, and pseudo random functions. Approved hashing functions are contained in Appendix A.

The use of outdated, cryptographically broken, proprietary encryption algorithms or hashing functions is prohibited. Due to the prevalence of incorrectly implemented cryptography, encryption products must have FIPS 140-3 Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules validation and be operated in FIPS mode. Refer to Appendix B Guidance in Selecting FIPS 140 Validated Products for further information.

Electronic information used to authenticate the identity of an individual or process (e.g., PIN, password, passphrase) must be encrypted when stored, transported, or transmitted. This does not include the distribution of a one-time use PIN, password, passphrase, token code, etc., provided it is not distributed along with any other authentication information (e.g., user-ID).

A system's security plan must include documentation to show appropriate review of encryption methodologies and products. This will demonstrate due diligence in choosing a method or product that has received substantial positive review by reputable third-party analysts.

## **4.1 Data in Transit**

Encryption is required for data in transit when

路 Electronic Personal, Private, or Sensitive Information (PPSI) is transmitted (including, but not limited to, e-mail, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), instant messaging, e-fax, Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), etc.).

路 Encryption of data in transit is prescribed by law or regulation.

路 Connecting to the State internal network(s) over a wireless network.

路 Remotely accessing the State internal network(s) or devices over a shared (e.g., Internet) or personal (e.g., Bluetooth, infrared) network. This does not apply to remote access over a State managed point to point dedicated connection.
