operations of ITS . Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## **3.0 Scope**

This Policy applies to ITS, its employees, contractors, consultants, and ITS supported agencies ("Client Agency").

## **4.0 Information Statement**

Requests for ITS support in reviewing and/or executing data sharing or computer matching agreements for or with Client Agencies come in many forms. For purposes of this Policy, requests regarding the described items below must be directed to the ITS Division of Legal Affairs ("DLA") at its.sm.dla@its.ny.gov before any commitments to the Client Agency are made on ITS's behalf.

Many ITS Client Agencies have computer matching, data sharing, or similar types of agreements with various federal, state, local, and private entities whereby these entities exchange electronic information and data with the Client Agencies, or vice versa. Often, these agreements include statutory or regulatory compliance requirements for the information technology systems that receive, process, store, and transfer the data to and from the entity to the Client Agency. ITS, as the agency primarily responsible for the management of those systems, is often asked to execute the agreements; however, with different entities having different language in each of the agreements, it is not always appropriate for ITS to be a party to the agreement. Below are the five (5) most common scenarios regarding these agreements and how ITS will respond to each:

a) For agreements where ITS, or the Client Agency's centralized information technology provider, is a required party, ITS will jointly execute the agreement with the Client Agency and the third party.

c) For agreements, new or old, that include information security addenda, or similar, ITS will sign the addenda, but not the underlying agreement unless specified above and where ITS provides information security services to the Client Agency.
