**4**3.3 Authentic, Reliable, Accessible E-records Over Time : All e-records must be maintained to be reliable, authentic, accessible, and usable for their legal retention periods. Those with long term or permanent retention requirements must be preserved in accessible and usable form or, for NYS agencies, transferred to NYSA. Other governmental entity e-records should be legally destroyed only under a records disposition authorization issued by NYSA or, for NYC, DORIS.

## **4.3.3.1 E-records Management Policies: Policies should:**

路 Specify what e-records are covered: Group e-records into "types" or "series" manageable in a consistent manner, e.g., by the business activity that created them ("vehicle registration," "fishing license file"), or to generic group ("accounting data," "customer documents"). E-records more critical for entity operations or more

likely needed for legal purposes should have more management attention and higher levels of protection. NYSA retention and disposition schedules provide guidance in determining record series for governmental e-records.

路 Establish file format standards : Designate approved data file formats for each record "type." Retrieving and displaying information on computer systems requires software which can change, either through new releases, or by changes to operating systems or hardware. A policy of approved media formats for e-records storage will facilitate data migration to ensure long-term retrieval of e-records.

路 Define responsibilities: Define responsibilities for implementing the policy among program and technical staff, and those specifically assigned to records management.

路 Develop controlled storage or filing systems maintaining e-record integrity and accessibility: Once created or captured, e-records must be retained in controlled environments maintaining their integrity and authenticity, in secure, reliable, and trustworthy e-records systems detecting and preventing unauthorized modifications. Document management or knowledge management products provide such solutions. The U.S. Department of Defense also tests and certifies document management products that include e-records management capabilities.
