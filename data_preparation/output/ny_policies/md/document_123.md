ITS recognizes and respects the employee's right to privacy and confidentiality. All information, including employee disclosures about victimization, shall be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law and policy without the employee's written informed consent, unless doing so creates a substantial risk of imminent danger to the victimized employee, other employees, or worksite. Should that circumstance occur, the victimized employee will be given notice of what actions will be taken by ITS and information will be given to only those employees deemed necessary for securing the

safety of the victim, other employees, or worksite. The information given to those employees will be as limited in scope as possible and employees may be required to sign an acknowledgement of confidentiality stating that any information, they have been given regarding the victimized employee must be used only for the intended purpose.
