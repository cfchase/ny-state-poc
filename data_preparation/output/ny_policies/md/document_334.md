It should be noted that the information provided in this privacy policy should not be construed as giving business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security of information provided through this website."

## **4.4.9 Other Considerations**

**a** Each SE's Internet privacy policy should also discuss how the SE addresses the collection of information from children. For example:

"The Agency does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this website. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in electronic mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. The Agency strongly encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online."

If the State Agency Website includes an area specifically intended for use by children or if any of the transactions offered on the website are available to children, the SE should be conscious of the rules adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) pursuant to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). While COPPA generally applies only to commercial websites, the FTC encourages others to post policies and provide protections that comply with COPPA if children provide personal information at their sites. Information concerning COPPA and the FTC rules is available at

**b** The SE may also wish to include contact information in the event that users have questions about the policy. At the SE's discretion, the contact for questions about the Internet privacy policy may be the employee designated to be responsible for compliance with the PPPL pursuant to section 94(1)(j) of the Public Officers Law.

**c** It may also be advisable for the Internet privacy policy to clearly state that websites to which the user may be linked from the State Agency Website are not subject to that policy and providing information that links to NYS authentication services is subject to the privacy policies of such authentication service. For example:
