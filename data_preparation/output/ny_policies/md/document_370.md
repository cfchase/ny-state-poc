Whether an offer is solicited or unsolicited, an employee must promptly notify their supervisor and the Ethics Officer of a job offer regardless of whether or not they intend to pursue that job offer.

Employees are prohibited from soliciting an employment opportunity with an entity or individual that has a specific pending matter before them. An employee may only solicit an employment opportunity with that individual or entity after waiting 30 days from the date the pending matter is closed or waiting 30 days after the date the employee has no further involvement with the matter because of recusal or reassignment.

If an employee receives an unsolicited job offer from an entity or individual that has a specific pending matter before that employee, then they cannot pursue employment with that entity or individual unless they seek recusal from the matter and any further official contact with the entity or individual and waits 30 days from such recusal to enter into any future employment discussions with the entity or individual.
