## **4.12 Non-ITS Employee Vehicle Use**

Use of State Vehicles by persons other than ITS employees (e.g., contractors) is highly restricted by ITS. Such use is only permitted to provide a service to the State. All approvals and re-approvals for use of a State Vehicle shall be at the complete discretion of the CIO.

Where these persons are approved to drive a State Vehicle, they must comply with this standard and the additional requirements detailed below. Only drivers with valid New York State licenses will be considered.

All drivers shall have valid, contract-compliant Certificates of Insurance on file with the ITS Procurement and Contract Services Unit (PaCS). In order to drive a State vehicle, drivers also need to provide proof the policy covers temporary vehicle replacement should the vehicle become damaged or unavailable. Should insurance coverage lapse at any time, the driver shall immediately cease operating the State vehicle(s) and shall be prohibited from operating any State vehicles until such time as ITS, in its sole

discretion, deems it necessary in order for the non-ITS employee to meet its service obligations to the State and proof of current, compliant insurance is provided.

Approvals shall expire at the end of the State's fiscal year (March 31) and no requests will be considered within the three (3) months before such date.

PaCS shall maintain all necessary records with the vendor's file.
