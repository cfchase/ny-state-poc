This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

All SE websites will use a standard domain naming convention which is determined and enforced by ITS.

## **4.1 Domain Naming Convention**

All domain names must:

· Be easily understood and recognizable by the residents of New York State Clearly communicate the purpose of the site;

· Be easy to type and avoid using confusing characters such as zeroes (0) in place of the letter "O" or the number one (1) in place of the letter "L" (l).

· Contain no less than 10 but no more than 36 characters, including the ny.gov portion of the domain name (the "dots" are considered characters - hence subdomains of ny.gov are to have at least 3 characters)

· Contain letters, numbers and dashes (-), but no other special characters such as underscores (_) and blank spaces;

· Avoid the use of acronyms whenever possible, unless the acronym meets one of the following conditions:

a) The SE is commonly known by the acronym, or

b) The acronym represents a commonly known major program. Major programs may be multiple or single agency programs but widely known to the general public. This program naming option is not intended for small, targeted audience programs. Web pages for such smaller programs must be part of the SE's main domain name pages (e.g., www.health.ny.gov/flu);

· Refrain from using general terms such as "licenses," "recreation," and "benefits" without an identifier because they do not represent a specific agency/program origin or service. For example, "DriversLicenses.ny.gov" may be allowed. Statewide services that would be best represented by a general term would be an infrequent exception to this rule (e.g., desktop.ny.gov, login.ny.gov).

· Use short URLs over a separate or sub-domain address, for areas on the same website (e.g., use health.ny.gov/flu instead of flu.health.ny.gov).

## **4.2 Naming Patterns**

## **4.2.1 Naming Patterns Within ny.gov Domain:**

Within the ny.gov domain, the allowed naming patterns are:

**"nys_entity_name"**ny.gov or

**"program_name"**ny.gov or

**"application_name"**"agency_name".ny.gov

**"program_name"**"agency_name".ny.gov

**"nys_entity_name"**ny.gov/"program_name" or

**"Microsoft_AD_domain"**ny.gov

## **4.3 General Domain Requirements**

In addition to the naming conventions, the following restrictions apply:

## **4.3.1 No Non-Government Advertisements**

A dot-gov domain and the ny.gov sub-domain, may not be used to advertise for private individuals, firms, corporations, or imply in any way the federal or state government endorses or favors any specific commercial product, commodity, or service.

## **4.3.2 No Political or Campaign Information**
