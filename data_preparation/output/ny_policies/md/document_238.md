All vehicle use in this example is consistent with this Policy because the State vehicle is used for official business and the personal use (driving to and from the restaurant) is incidental to official business .

Example 2 An employee has an all-day meeting in a different part of the State. Because it would not be practical to pick up or off the vehicle from the official work location on the of the meeting, the employee takes a State vehicle home the evening to the meeting, drives to the meeting early the next morning, drives home that evening; and returns the vehicle the following morning day drop prior

All vehicle use in this example is consistent with this Policy because driving from the official work location to home and from home back to the official work location is personal use incidental to official business .

## **Example 3**

the supermarket; while clearly personal, is a minor deviation from official State business and is considered incidental to official State business.

Same facts as Example 2, except that on the trip back to home the employee stops to pick up a loaf of bread and a gallon of milk at a supermarket that is on the route home. All vehicle use in this example is consistent with this Policy because the brief stop at

the supermarket; while clearly personal, is a minor deviation from official State business and is considered incidental to official State business.

Example 4 Same facts as Example 3, except that instead of stopping briefly at a supermarket on the route home, the employee stops at an outlet mall just off the highway to for one hour; shop

Even assuming that the employee stops at the outlet mall outside %f his or her regular work hours, using the State vehicle for outlet shopping violates this Policy. Unlike the stop in Example 3, the purpose of this detour is not to obtain necessary items of sustenance (such as bread and milk) , nor is the detour brief. For these reasons , the personal use of the vehicle is clearly not incidental to official business.
