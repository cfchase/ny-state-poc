**a** Individual Accounts are a unique account issued to a single user. The account enables the user to authenticate to IT resources with a digital identity. After a user (e.g., NYS citizen, resident, employee, or other applicable user type) is authenticated, the user is authorized or denied access to the system based on the permissions that are assigned directly or indirectly to that user.

**b** Privileged Accounts are an account which provides increased access and requires additional authorization. Examples include a network, system, or security administrator account. A Privileged Account may only be provided to members of the workforce who require it to accomplish their job duties. The use of Privileged Accounts must be compliant with the principle of Least Privilege, with access restricted to only those programs or processes specifically needed to perform authorized business tasks and no more. There are two privileged account types - Administrative Accounts and Default Privileged Accounts.

**1** Administrative Accounts are given to a user to allow the right to modify the operating system or platform settings, or those which allow modifications to other accounts.

## **Administrative accounts must:**

· Not have user IDs that give any indication of the user's privilege level, (e.g., supervisor, manager, administrator, or any flavor thereof);

· Be at an IAL commensurate with the protected IT resources to which they access;

· Be internally identifiable to the SE as an administrative account per a standardized naming convention; and

· When no longer required, be revoked in accordance with the NYS-S20-001: Digital Identity Standard.

**2** Default Privileged Accounts (e.g., root, Administrator) are provided for a particular system and cannot be removed without affecting the functionality of the system.

## **Default privileged accounts must:**

· Only be used for the initial system installation or as a service account. When technically feasible, alerts must be issued to the appropriate personnel when there is an attempt to log in with the account for access;

· Be disabled if not in use or renamed if technically possible;

· Not use the initial default password provided with the system; and
