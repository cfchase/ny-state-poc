# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

Domestic violence and other forms of gender-based violence permeate the lives and harm thousands of New Yorkers each day, with tragic, destructive, and often fatal results. The impacts of such violence are felt in the workplace, regardless of where the incidents are taking place, and have the potential to compromise the safety of victims, co-workers, and clients, while resulting in lost productivity, increased health care costs, absenteeism, and employee turnover. Employers have both a moral and legal obligation to their employees who may be experiencing victimization.

New York State law recognizes that domestic and gender-based violence occurs within a wide spectrum of relationships, therefore ITS will take every appropriate measure to prevent and/or address domestic and gender-based violence as it impacts the workplace, while also recognizing the rights of victims to have self-determination and the need to respond in a survivor-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive manner. All valid orders of protection shall be enforced by ITS and all protections of this policy shall apply. This policy shall apply to all victims of gender-based violence, regardless of where the incidents took place.

ITS, to the fullest extent possible, without violating any existing rules, regulations, statutory requirements, contractual obligations, or collective bargaining agreements, designates and directs appropriate management, supervisory, and/or human resources staff to implement the following Gender-Based Violence and the Workplace Policy.
