Upon submission of the Exception Request Form, the CISO's office will contact the requester to confirm receipt and request additional information, if needed. Once all required information has been received, the CISO will either grant or deny the request.

Upon approval, the CISO's office will send the approved Exception Request Form to the requestor. If the request is denied, the Exception Request Form will be returned with a brief explanation of why the CISO denied the request.

In the event that the request is denied, the Commissioner/Executive Deputy Commissioner and the CIO who signed the Exception Request Form may request a meeting with the State CIO and the CISO to discuss the circumstances giving rise to the request and means of addressing those circumstances.
