# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) was established in 2012 to provide centralized technology services to customer agencies, set New York State's (NYS) technology standards, and coordinate and govern statewide technology-related initiatives, thereby improving the efficiency of New York State government.

ITS strives to provide high quality, secure, and cost-effective technology in support of state agencies and their missions. With respect to workplace computing devices, this is achieved by standardizing configurations, accommodating exceptions in a consistent manner, and managing asset lifecycles in a defined, consistent interval.
