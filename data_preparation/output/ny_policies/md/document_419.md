## **4.0 Information Statement**

## **4.1 Advertising by Private Entities on State Entity Websites**

An SE's website should not be used for commercial, non-official-related purposes. This is the case even if the SE's website is hosted by a private entity. Before permitting any advertising on an SE website, the SE should consult with its legal counsel to determine whether it has the requisite express or implicit authority and whether such advertising would further the SE's purpose or mission.

## **4.2 Banner Ads, Pop Ups and Vendor-Hosted Website Advertising**

Banner Ads, Pop Up Ads, and vendor-hosted website advertising create the following issues which should be assessed by the SE's legal counsel:

· Advertising for private individuals, firms, or corporations can imply that the SE endorses or favors a specific commercial product, commodity, or service. Citizens expect their government to be impartial. Businesses and for-profit entities also expect to be treated fairly by the government. Endorsing some commercial products and services, while excluding others, may constitute preferential treatment.

· Privacy violations may occur when a user accesses web advertisement. This is because advertisers frequently engage in behavioral targeting of web users through data collection. Some websites record information about users by automatically depositing a piece of information in the "cookie" file on the user's computer. The cookie helps track information communicated between the user's browser and the server.
