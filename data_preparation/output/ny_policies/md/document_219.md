**5** ITS retains the right to require any driver using a State Vehicle to participate in a safe driving program and/or revoke driving privileges for any person(s) whose driving habits or record indicate: (i) pattern of unsafe operation; (ii) change in licensure as a result of DMV action which restricts driving privileges, unless the operation of the State Vehicle complies with such restrictions; or (iii) any incident or series of incidents that reasonably appear to reflect adversely on driving skills or ability.

**6** Any driver who uses or may use a State Vehicle must annually receive the State Vehicle Usage Policy and acknowledge in writing to Facilities that they have

received and read those documents. Written acknowledgement by email or other electronic means is acceptable. Facilities will maintain the acknowledgements.

**7** Non-compliance with this policy may result in a loss of eligibility for use of State Vehicles.

## **4.2 Assignment of Vehicles**
