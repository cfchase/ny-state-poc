This standard applies to all "State Entities," defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this standard and an SE's standard, the more restrictive standard will take precedence.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

## **4.1 Risk Management Process**

Information security risk management is an organizational function that considers vulnerabilities, threat sources, identified risks, and security controls within an organization's environment. These factors help determine the resulting level of risk posed to SE information, systems, processes, and individuals that support SE business functions. Risk management and subsequent assessment activities can take many forms (e.g., formal risk assessment, audits, security reviews, configuration analysis, vulnerability scanning and testing, etc.), which all aim to identify and respond to risk in ways that improve an SE's overall security posture. An SE can never completely eliminate risk but can take steps to better manage risk.

There are four components of a risk management program: risk framing, risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring. Each of these components, briefly defined below, are outlined in further detail in subsequent sections.

路 Risk Framing - establishes the context and common strategy for SE risk management activities.

路 Risk Response - approved response types to identified risks; and

路 Risk Assessment - procedures for identifying, categorizing, and prioritizing risk to SE operations, assets, data, and more.

路 Risk Monitoring - ongoing maintenance activities associated with identified risks.
