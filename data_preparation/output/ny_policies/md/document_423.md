This standard applies to all administrators of Bring Your Own Device ("BYOD") programs.

The BYOD devices encompassed in the scope of this standard includes computers, smartphones, tablets and other personal devices that can access ITS Resources.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

This standard identifies four methods of accessing State data and the level of management required:

## **4.1 Viewer-based Access**

In the viewer-based access model, users can access State data via web applications or ITS-managed interfaces (e.g., a home PC logging into a State Entity (SE) website to obtain information, either public or personally accessible to the user, such as accessing email through a webmail client). Since the data in this level does not reside on the BYOD device, no State management of the BYOD device is required.

## **4.2 Application Access**

In the application model, all access to State data from the BYOD device is delivered via applications, which securely isolate State data from personal data on the BYOD device. Application examples include Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) or terminal clients that do not store State data, web browsers, or applications that encrypt data stored on the BYOD devices (e.g., a State employee accesses a SE managed desktop (physical or virtual) with a Secure Socket Layer Virtual Private Network (SSL-VPN) client). In this instance, the SE manages the BYOD device and access method.

Applications used in this manner must have the following capabilities:

**1** Applications must not store plaintext State data on the BYOD device. Any State data stored on the BYOD device must be stored in a manner consistent with relevant security policies and encryption standards.

**2** Applications must disallow access to State data from other applications on the BYOD device, unless access is secured in a manner consistent with relevant security policies and encryption standards.

## **4.3 Native Messaging and Calendar Access**

In the messaging access model, end users are authorized to connect BYOD devices to State messaging platforms using approved methods.

To allow this type of connectivity, BYOD devices must have the following capabilities:
