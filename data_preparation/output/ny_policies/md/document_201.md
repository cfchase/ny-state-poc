Individual accountability is required when accessing all IT resources and State information. Users are responsible for protecting against unauthorized activities performed under their user ID. This includes locking your computer screen when you walk away from your system, logging off at the end of your work session and protecting your credentials (e.g., passwords, tokens, or similar technology) from unauthorized disclosure. Credentials must be treated as confidential information and must not be disclosed or shared.

Users must ensure their connection of State IT resources is through a known and secured network, such as through the use of a hot spot associated with a state-issued mobile device, or a State-maintained portal that requires user authentication or where the network connection requires a password that is unique to you. A coffee shop or hotel network, for example, that is available for use without these controls is vulnerable to a cyber incident.

## **4.5 Restrictions on Off-Site Transmission and Storage of Information**

Users must not transmit restricted SE, non-public, personal, private, sensitive, or confidential information to or from personal email accounts (e.g., Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo) or use a personal email account to conduct State business. Users must not store restricted SE information that is non-public, personal, private, sensitive, or confidential on a non-State issued device, or with a third-party file storage service that has not been approved for such storage by the SE.

Devices that contain SE information must be attended to at all times or physically secured and must not be checked in transportation carrier luggage systems.

## **4.6 User Responsibility for IT Equipment**

Users are routinely assigned or given access to State IT equipment to perform their official duties. Users must maintain proper use of the equipment and protect the equipment from theft, damage, abuse, and unauthorized use. Users must never deliberately damage or destroy the equipment or its components. This equipment belongs to the State and must be immediately returned upon request or at the time a user is separated from SE service. Users may be financially responsible for the value of equipment assigned to their care if it is not returned to the SE.
