**b** Modifying Account Attributes (i.e., changing users' names, demographics, etc.) Modifications must only be made by the authenticated user or an authorized account manager.

**c** Enabling Access Access is granted, based on the principle of Least Privilege, with a valid access authorization.

**d** Modifying Access Access modifications must include a valid authorization. When there is a position change (not including separation), access is immediately reviewed and removed when no longer needed.

## **e. Disabling Accounts or Removing Access**

· Event/Risk Based (Administrative Disable) When an account poses or has the potential to pose a significant risk, either the account is disabled, or access attributes are removed upon discovery of the risk. Close coordination between the Information Owners, account managers and administrators, legal, incident response stakeholders and human resource managers is essential for timely execution of removing or restricting user access. Significant risk may include a disgruntled employee or one who has been identified by the SE as a potential risk. Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to IT resources to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and

assets, individuals, or other organizations. An account identifier is required to identify these accounts and prevent inappropriate re-enabling of the account or access. Re-enabling the account requires explicit approval of the SE. Self-service mechanisms may not be used to re-enable the account.

· De-provisioning Upon Separation -All user accounts (including privileged) must be disabled immediately upon separation. In addition, credentials must be revoked in accordance with the NYS-S20-001: Digital Identity Standard, and access attributes must be removed. Self-service mechanisms may not be used to re-enable the account.

· Inactivity Disable When an account is disabled due to inactivity, access attributes may remain unchanged if deemed appropriate by the Information Owner.
