# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

Vulnerability scanning is a process by which vulnerabilities are identified. Vulnerability Management (VM) is a process by which the vulnerabilities identified through scanning are tracked, evaluated, prioritized, and managed until the vulnerabilities are remediated or otherwise appropriately resolved. VM ensures that appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Information Technology (IT) Resources.
