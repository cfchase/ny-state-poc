The information provided in the following section includes activities that are involved in a robust IR Process Flow. All SEs must strive to meet the outlined activities to most efficiently and completely remediate a security incident. Not all activities will be required for every incident. Significant cyber incidents that involve physical or government service impacts may be designated as major incidents. Consequence management for the noncyber impacts of the response could require an expanded State response, which may involve Multi-Agency Coordination Calls or activation of the State Emergency Operations Center (EOC), coordinated by DHSES OEM.

The CISA Cybersecurity Incident & Vulnerability Response Playbooks provide a standardized response process for cybersecurity incidents and describes the process and completion through the incident response phases as defined in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-61 Rev. 2, including coordination, preparation, detection and analysis, containment, eradication and recovery, and post-incident activities. NYS has adopted a phased approach consisting of activities as depicted below:

## **4.2.1 Preparation**

Proper planning and preparation for an incident before it occurs ensures a more effective and efficient IR process. As per the NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy, SEs must have a documented IR plan, consistent with NYS information technology standards, to effectively respond to security incidents.

## **Activities**

**1** Train Response Personnel

· Ensure personnel are trained, exercised, and ready to respond to security incidents. Train all staffing resources that may draw from in-house capabilities, available capabilities at a parent agency/department, third-party organization, or any combination.

**2** Policies and Procedures

· Prepare documented IR plans and procedures that include an up-to-date IR contact list and address notification, interaction, and evidence collection, sharing, and chain of custody procedures.
