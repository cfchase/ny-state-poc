The dot-gov domain, and the ny.gov sub-domain, is for the sole operation of government, not for use in any political, political party, or campaign environment. No campaigning can be conducted with dot-gov domains. No dot-gov website may link, directly or indirectly, or refer to websites created or operated by a campaign or any campaign entity or political or campaign committee. Political sites, party names, or party acronyms cannot be used.

## **4.3.3 Two-Year Eligibility Period**

All dot-gov domains are registered for a 2-year period. During this period, a review of eligibility and administrative information is required. If necessary, the dot-gov Registrar will contact the Administrative Point of Contact (APOC) for domains. APOC information MUST be kept current. The dot-gov Registrar may request an updated authorization letter, updated Domain Name Server (DNS) information, or other information. This information enables the federal government to ensure dot-gov domains provide secure, official websites and promote the best possible service to the general public.

## **4.4 Procedure to Request a Domain Name**

SEs must obtain ITS approval before requesting any new third level domains (i.e., "agency_name".ny.gov or "program_name".ny.gov) using the form at https://on.ny.gov/domain-exception-request. ITS will review and respond to all requests within five (5) business days.

Once a domain has been determined and approved, the appropriate ITS Customer Relations Manager can submit a Service Request ticket to initiate the work required for set up in the ITSM service catalog: Network Services > DNS Entry.

## **4.5 Use of Approved Domains.**

SEs should use only ny.gov domains. It is highly discouraged to use any other top-level domain unless the head of the SE explicitly determines another domain is necessary for the proper performance of an SE function. The use of any other domain runs the risk of the domain being lost or acquired by another entity. The ny.gov address ensures the public that it is an official state site and can be trusted.
