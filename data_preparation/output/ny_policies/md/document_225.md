State Vehicles must be serviced and maintained according to factory recommendations. OGS has a contract with a national fleet maintenance account program whereby State Vehicles can receive repairs and maintenance services, including car washes. It is the POC's responsibility to ensure that all prescribed schedules and any routine maintenance reminders are followed, as well as promptly responding to any observed warning signs or sounds. Each POC is responsible for scheduling oil changes, maintenance and inspections on the State Vehicle assigned to their location, at an OGS contracted facility.
