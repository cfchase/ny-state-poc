| ITS Policy :  Mobile Device  Provisioning,  Deprovisioning, and  Replacement | Updated:  12/22/2020  Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner:  Chief Technology Office   Workplace Services |

# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The rapid growth and availability of mobile technology solutions makes it possible to perform official business outside the constraints of the traditional office setting. Mobile technology enables users to not only send and receive voice calls, email, and text messages, but also allows them to access business data and applications from anywhere at any time. Users whose job responsibilities frequently take them away from the office can take full advantage of mobile technology solutions to conduct State business, communicate effectively, and securely access New York State ("NYS" or "State") data when required.

This mobile device policy ("Policy"), issued by the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS), sets forth mobile device provisioning and deprovisioning processes; defines standard vs non-standard mobile devices, including accessories; sets forth the billing process for device counts in excess of the established baseline; and establishes a mobile device repair/replacement policy for a device that is inoperable, lost or stolen.

ITS strives to provide a high quality, sustainable, secure, and cost-effective mobile experience through issuing mobile standards and normalized rate plans. ITS mobile service rates can be found at https://its.ny.gov/service-rates. Additionally, this Policy will ensure the State's mobile technology assets are deployed appropriately and consistently. 1
