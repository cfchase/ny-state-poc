competitively bid contract; (2) may not appear before any State agency or render services for compensation in a matter before any State agency in connection with such matters as the purchase, sale, rental or lease of real property, or goods or services, rate making, funding, adoption, or repeal of any rule or regulation having the force and effect of law, licensing, or any proceeding relating to a franchise provided for in the Public Service Law; and (3) may not have any interest in or engage in any business or activity "in substantial conflict" with the discharge of their public duties.

## **4.4 Restrictions Concerning Outside Activities and Employment**

While there is no general prohibition against employees engaging in outside activities or employment, certain requirements do apply. All outside employment must be approved by ITS in writing prior to commencement and must be reapproved annually, unless otherwise authorized by the Ethics Officer ( see Form HR-09). Certain outside activities require similar approval. Such outside activities or employment may necessitate recusal or preclusion in certain circumstances in order to prevent an actual conflict of interest or to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Ethics Officer may rescind approval at any time for any reason, including but not limited to changes in work duties, performances, or failure to comply with ITS or State policies.

Outside activities or employment: (1) cannot interfere with the performance of the employee's duties at ITS; (2) cannot be performed during the employee's working hours at ITS without charging appropriate leave accruals after receiving appropriate leave permission; (3) cannot be performed at the employee's worksite, involve any use of State property, equipment, supplies, facilities, or resources; (4) cannot require the disclosure of confidential or other official information obtained through the employee's duties; and (5) cannot create a conflict of interest, appearance of a conflict of interest, or appearance of impropriety.
