## **Exhibit 1 - Calculating Risk**

The level of risk presented by a specific scenario is calculated through a combination of the impact (level of harm) and the likelihood of that event occurring. Impact and likelihood ratings must be documented with written justification when conducting a risk assessment.

Table 1 defines qualitative and semi-quantitative values (0-100 or 1-10 scales) to facilitate likelihood determinations as part of a risk assessment.

Adapted from NIST Special Publication 800-30 Tables G-2 through G-4
