## **ITS Reports to Agency Designees**

Consistent with the pre-existing process that commenced in January 2015 and has operated continuously since then, ITS will continue to generate and provide regular reports identifying inactive mailboxes for agency review. Consistent with the pre-existing process, agencies continue to be required to designate staff to monitor a shared mailbox for purposes of receiving bi-weekly reports of accounts that have become stale. 2 Most agencies have already designated staff for this purpose pursuant to the pre-existing process, and these staff continue

to have access to the appropriate shared mailbox to ensure compliance with the May 2016 Inactive Mailbox Management Process. If you wish to add a designee, or make changes your agency's designee(s), please notify ITS at its.sm.EES@its.ny.gov .
