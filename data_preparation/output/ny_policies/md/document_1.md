# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

This policy defines the scenarios when application and scripting development activities may be performed by ITS Client Agency program staff. This policy also defines the acceptable use of Client Agency Development Platforms.

## **2.0 Authority**

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines .

## **3.0 Scope**

This policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, interns, and ITS

supported agencies ("Client Agency"). This policy applies to any application or scripting development activities that are managed outside of the ITS intake process. Activities relating to data analytics, such as generating reports, are not considered Client Agency application or scripting development activities. Therefore, these activities are not in the scope of this policy.
