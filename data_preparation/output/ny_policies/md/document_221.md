**c** An employee who is required to stay overnight may drive the State Vehicle to a restaurant for a meal after work hours if the restaurant is within reasonable proximity to the overnight lodging.

The following are examples of inappropriate use of State vehicles:

**a** An employee uses a State Vehicle to commute between the employee's home and official work location unless commuting is specifically authorized by the Director of State Operations.

**b** An employee takes a State Vehicle home overnight prior to a meeting in another part of the state but uses the vehicle that evening to take three friends to a leisure activity. Travel to and from the leisure activity is not considered incidental personal use and is not permitted. In addition, carrying persons who are not State employees and who are not engaged in official State business violates this Policy and creates a potential liability for the State.

Even in cases where personal use is authorized or is incidental to official business, each driver operating a State Vehicle is expected to exercise good judgment to avoid the appearance of impropriety.

**2** All personal use of State Vehicles must be reported on the State Vehicle Usage Record unless the personal use is incidental to official business. For any personal use that is not incidental, the user of the State Vehicle must reimburse ITS the value of such use, or the value must be treated as imputed personal income for tax purposes.

**3** In circumstances where neither mass transit nor a State Vehicle is available, employees may use the least expensive option of either a rental car suitable under the circumstances or their personal car. Employees must use the "trip calculator" found on the Office of General Services' (OGS) website: http://www.ogs.ny.gov/bu/ss/trav/calculators.asp to determine which mode is cheaper. Employees may opt to use their personal cars in non-optimal situations but will only be reimbursed for the lesser value of the car rental or available mass transit.
