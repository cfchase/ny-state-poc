The Universal Navigation is designed to work with various accessibility requirements. A "skip to content" or "skip to navigation" link is commonly used at the top of a webpage as a way to accommodate visitors utilizing screen readers or with limited motor abilities. When possible, a "skip to content" link should:

**1** Remain hidden from normal view until engaged with no space between the Universal Navigation header element and the top of the web page or application.

**2** Act as the initial link for screen readers.

**3** Appear when common accessibility practices are engaged.
