# Title: **$^{ }$1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The Office of Information Technology Services ("ITS") is entrusted with managing the User accounts and access privileges of ITS and its supported agencies ("Client Agency"). Part of managing these accounts means maintaining standardized offboarding of User accounts upon State employee, contractor, or consultant (collectively referred to herein as "User(s)") separation from ITS or a Client Agency.

Offboarding is the process used to revoke accounts and access from separating Users. Proper offboarding is necessary to facilitate the appropriate deactivation of accounts, to ensure ITS and Client Agencies meet their legal obligations on this topic, and to secure the return of all ITS-owned equipment and assets. Proper offboarding also ensures the security of state resources and data.

This policy outlines the importance of appropriate offboarding, defines specific types of offboarding, and ultimately establishes a collaborative workflow that involves ITS technical staff, ITS Enterprise eDiscovery Services ("EES"), and Client Agency legal counsel, or their designee.
