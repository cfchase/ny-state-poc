Telecommuting is an alternate work arrangement that allows employees to conduct some of their work away from their official work site. ITS's policy is to support telecommuting where it is reasonable to do so based on the agency's mission and operational needs.

The Telecommuting Program is completely voluntary. Every application will be considered on an individual basis. ITS reserves the right to unilaterally approve, disapprove, modify, revoke, or suspend any individual's participation in this program pursuant to procedures outlined in Section 4.3.5. Telecommuting is not operationally feasible for all job functions. The Bureau Director, or designee, determines which job functions are eligible to participate in this program. Determinations as to which job functions are eligible for telecommuting are final and cannot be appealed.

This program will sunset on June 30, 2025 but can be extended at the discretion of ITS. ITS will comply with any current or future obligations under collective bargaining agreements regarding telecommuting, including meeting with union representatives prior to the termination of the Telecommuting Program if required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.

## **4.1 Types of Telecommuting**

Regularly Scheduled - Routine telecommuting arrangement with a set schedule.

Exceptions - A telecommuting arrangement that exceeds 50% of the telecommuter's regularly scheduled work hours in a pay period and requested on a temporary and adhoc basis. These requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
