**b** SEs must provide simple methods to physically disconnect collaborative computing devices.

## **4.14 Vulnerability Management**

**a** All systems must be scanned for vulnerabilities before being installed in production and periodically thereafter.

**b** All systems are subject to periodic penetration testing.

**c** Penetration tests are required periodically for all critical environments/systems.

**d** Where a SE has outsourced a system to another SE or a third party, vulnerability scanning/penetration testing must be coordinated.

**e** Vulnerability scanning/penetration testing and mitigation must be included in third party agreements.

**f** The output of the vulnerability scans/penetration tests will be reviewed in a timely manner by the system owner. Copies of the scan report/penetration test must be shared with the ISO/designated security representative for the evaluation of risk.

**g** Appropriate action, such as patching or updating the system, must be taken to address discovered vulnerabilities. For any discovered vulnerability, a plan of action and milestones must be created, and updated accordingly, to document the planned remedial actions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

**h** Any vulnerability scanning/penetration testing must be conducted by individuals who are authorized by the ISO/designated security representative. The CISO must be notified in advance of any such tests. Any other attempts to perform such vulnerability scanning/penetration testing will be deemed an unauthorized access attempt.

**i** Anyone authorized to perform vulnerability scanning/penetration testing must have a formal process defined, tested and followed at all times to minimize the possibility of disruption.
