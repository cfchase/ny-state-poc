As established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment, no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before turning over equipment to ITS.

In accordance with Section 168 of the SFL, prior to surplus or disposal of E-equipment, consideration should be given to donating to the Computer Recycling for Education and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) program. This program was created to take computer equipment that is no longer needed by the state and private industry and distribute to schools, libraries, and other educational institutions.

## **4.2 Furniture and Miscellaneous Equipment**

If the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will re-deploy the item to a new location or individual.

If the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to have value but is no longer needed for ITS use (i.e., items that are still in reasonably good shape and/or still function properly but are no longer needed by the business unit), a CS-201 Form must be completed and, if applicable, the Information Security Certification must be signed. The completed form, along with digital pictures, must be sent to ITS Facilities Services at its.sm.surplus@its.ny.gov, for authorization and processing. Once all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the furniture or miscellaneous equipment drop-off with OGS.

ITS Facilities Services will work with the business unit to review the form. If the form is complete, ITS Facilities Services will approve and authorize the disposal of furniture or miscellaneous equipment. If the form is incomplete, it will be returned to the requestor for revision. Furniture and miscellaneous equipment cannot be removed without the proper approval and authorization as indicated above.
