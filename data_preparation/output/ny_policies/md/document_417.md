**5** Mobile devices which directly connect to SE private networks or virtually connect to SE private networks in a manner consistent with a directly connected device must be managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) or other centralized management solution.

**6** Mobile devices which contain or may contain SE information must be managed with MDM or other centralized management solution, or access to the SE information must be made via applications controlled with a Mobile Application Management (MAM) solution.

**7** Use of mobile device synchronization services, including backups (e.g., local device synchronization, remote synchronization services, and websites) must be controlled by the SE through an MDM or other centralized management solution.

**8** The mobile device's operating environment integrity must be verified (including whether the device has been rooted/jailbroken) prior to accessing SE private networks

**9** SEs must manage all mobile devices by:

**a** Implementing mobile device policies and configurations as appropriate to the use of the mobile device.

**b** Developing and implementing processes that check for upgrades and patches to the mobile device's software components, and for appropriately acquiring, testing, and deploying the updates to State-issued mobile devices, when technically possible.

**c** Providing a mechanism to quarantine, or otherwise isolate, a mobile device from SE private networks or applications if it is below a minimum OS version or software patch level.

**d** Reconfiguring access control features as needed based on factors such as policy changes, technology changes, audit findings, and new security needs.

**e** Detecting and documenting anomalies that may indicate malicious activity or deviations from policy and procedures. Anomalies should be reported to other systems' administrators as appropriate.

**f** Providing training and awareness activities for mobile device users on threats and recommended security practices that can be incorporated into the SE's security and awareness training.
