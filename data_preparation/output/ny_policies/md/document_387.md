Labor Law Section 203-d: (i) states it shall be presumptive evidence of a knowing legal violation of this section if an employer has not put into place policies or procedures to safeguard against such violations, including provisions to notify employees; and (ii) provides the Commissioner of Labor authority to impose monetary civil penalties for such knowing violations.

Accordingly, SEs should have policies in place to comply with the requirements of section 203-d. These policies should include:

路 an outline of the prohibitions of section 203-d; and

路 procedures instituted by the SE to safeguard against unlawful disclosure, including as applicable notice to and training of its workforce.

To the extent a SE is using technology systems to accomplish any of the purposes described above (e.g. using the entity's employees' SSNs as identification numbers in its technology systems) it should modify its IT systems to comply with these requirements.

## **NYS PPPL SECTION 96-a**

**1** Section 96-a of the PPPL, effective January 1, 2010 (hereinafter "Section 96-a"), extends the prohibitions of Section 399-dd of the General Business Law to the context of the State and its political subdivisions (hereinafter "the State"). These restrictions fall into two main groups: (a) prohibitions against what the State can do; and (b) limitations on what the State can require individuals to do.

Section 96-a defines a " social security account number " to " include the nine-digit account number issued by the federal social security administration and any number derived therefrom" but not "any number that has been encrypted ." Under Section 96-a: Unless required by law, the State shall not:

路 Intentionally communicate to the general public or otherwise make available to the general public in any manner an individual's social security account number.

路 Print an individual's social security account number on any card or tag required for the individual to access products, services, or benefits provided by the state and its political subdivisions.
