In all cases, until a final determination is made by ITS Facilities Services, the business unit is responsible for storing items. There is no ITS centralized warehouse area to hold furniture or miscellaneous equipment.

## **4.3 Vehicles**

When a business unit determines a State Vehicle should be removed from service, the business unit must notify ITS Facilities Services. If the vehicle is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will deploy it to a new location. If ITS Facilities Services determines the vehicle will be surplused, the following actions are to be taken:

· All decals, etc., except for inspection and registration stickers, must be removed and the vehicle cleaned inside and out.

· The vehicle is to be transported to the Swan Street location if the normal assigned parking for that vehicle is not in Albany/Capital District.

When the State Vehicle is turned in to ITS Facilities Services, all related items such as gas cards, Fleet Service cards/manuals, E-ZPass tags, and completed/signed mileage reports are also to be turned in.

ITS Facilities Services will process the State Vehicle to OGS for auction, transfer, or disposal by filling out a Report of Surplus Motor Vehicles and Motorized Equipment, CS-201.1 Form. ITS Facilities Services will further notify all concerned parties that the vehicle is no longer in service.

Once all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the State Vehicle drop-off with OGS.

## **5.0 Compliance**

This policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all ITS policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.
