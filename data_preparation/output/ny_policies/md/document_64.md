The NY State Private Cloud may include services in public or private facilities based on compliance with security requirements.

The NY State Private Cloud is a framework of services that provide New York State entities with secure technology services and solutions. NY State Private Cloud provides a set of shared core technology services including, but not limited to, User Identity, Network Domain Naming, IT Service Management (ITSM), Monitoring, and Security Logging.

Third-Party Cloud services can integrate with the NY State Private Cloud framework. In this context, a Third-Party cloud refers to any external cloud hosting not directly managed by ITS. Integration requires that Third-Party Cloud services utilize core or enterprise services consistent with ITS Technical Standards and meet or exceed the security and legal requirements associated with State data.

The authorization to use a Third-party cloud may only be granted by the NYS Chief Technology Officer (CTO) or an assigned designee. ITS shall keep an approved list of authorized designees.

## **4.1.2 Information Owner Responsibility**

All data security requirements, including identifying geographic residency, are the responsibility of the agency information owners (see "Determining the Information Owner" in the NYS-S14-002: Information Classification Standard).
