The considerations listed above are representative only and should not be viewed as encompassing all possible risks of accessing non-public NYS systems or data f rom international locations. These considerations, and any other factors deemed appropriate, must be reviewed, and instructions must be created and established by the specific SE's legal counsel, ISO/designated security representative, Information Technology department, or other stakeholders as designated by the SE, that outline the approval process and the required security controls to limit the risk of this access.

For SEs receiving services from the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS), explicit approval for international access must be obtained from the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO). SEs who do not receive

services from ITS can reference Appendix A for security controls to better secure nonpublic NYS systems and data for access from international locations.
