| Purge   | forClearas long as the device interface available to the userdoesnotfacilitate retrieval  of the Cleared data.  Some methods of purging (which vary by media and must be applied with  considerations described further throughout this document) include overwrite, block  erase, and Cryptographic Erase, through the use of dedicated, standardized device  sanitize commands that apply media-specific techniques to bypass the abstraction  inherent in typical read and write commands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|         | Destructive techniques also render the device Purged when effectively applied to the  appropriate media type, including incineration, shredding, disintegrating, degaussing,  and pulverizing. The common benefit across all these approaches is assurance that  the data is infeasible to recover using state of the art laboratory techniques. However,  Bending,Cutting,and the use of some emergencyprocedures (such as using a firearm  to shoot a hole through a storage device) may only damage the media as portions of  the media may remain undamaged and therefore accessible using advanced  laboratory techniques.                                                                                             |
| Destroy | unusable (and in those cases, degaussing is also a destruction technique).  There are many different types, techniques, and procedures for media destruction.  While some techniques may render the Target Data infeasible to retrieve through the  device interface and unable to be used for subsequent storage of data, the device is  not considered destroyed unless Target Data retrieval is infeasible using state of the  art laboratory techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|         | · Disintegrate, Pulverize, Melt, and Incinerate . These sanitization methods are  designed to completely destroy the media. They are typically carried out at  an outsourced metal destruction or licensed incineration facility with the  specific capabilities to perform these activities effectively, securely, and  safely.  · Shred . Paper shredders can be used to destroy flexible media such as  diskettes once the media are physically removed from their outer containers.  The shred size of the refuse should be small enough that there is reasonable  assurance in proportion to the data confidentiality that the data cannot be  reconstructed. To make reconstructing the data even more difficult, the |
