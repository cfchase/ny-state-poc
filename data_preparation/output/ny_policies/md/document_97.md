During an incident, clear and effective communication to all IR stakeholders is critical so that everyone has the necessary information to act and carry out their responsibilities promptly. As such, an escalation procedure must address all lines of communication in the event an incident occurs. This includes both internal and external communications. Notification must be made as soon as possible but should not delay an SE from taking appropriate actions to isolate and contain the damage.

Each SE must have a documented IR escalation procedure that consists of:

· an escalation matrix;

· an up-to-date contact list with alternate contacts; and

· multiple communications channels that ensure appropriate and accurate information is disseminated quickly to the appropriate IR stakeholders.

## **Incident Tracking & Reporting**

A secure centralized tracking system that can accommodate "need toknow" access leads to a more efficient and systematic IR effort, as well as providing an audit trail, should the efforts lead to legal prosecution of the threat.

At a minimum, documentation of the incident must contain the following information:

· Date / time the incident was reported

· Type of Incident

· Reporting source of incident

· Summary of the incident

· Current status of the incident

· All actions taken concerning the incident

· Contact information for all involved parties

· Evidence and its chain of custody gathered during incident investigation

· Relevant comments from IR team members

· Proposed next steps to be taken

## **4.2.3 Containment**

This step focuses on containing the threat to minimize and further reduce damage. It is during this step that information is collected to determine how the attack occurred. All affected systems within the enterprise should be identified by Cyber First Responders, so that containment, eradication, and recovery is effective and complete.

## **Activities**

**1** Isolating impacted systems

· Taking systems off the network or isolating the infected systems to keep the infrastructure safe.

**2** Capturing forensic images

· Preserves the evidence for further action and any legal action.

**3** Other techniques that are involved in containment
