A supervisor may request the termination of a telecommuter's agreement to the second-level supervisor at any time based on:

· Productivity/Performance issues

· Private workspace non-compliance

· Unresponsiveness during telecommuting

· Unresolvable technology issues

· Other operational needs

When a supervisor would like to remove an approved telecommuter from the Telecommuting Program for the above reasons, they must:

**1** Notify the employee in writing of the revocation up to thirty days in advance of the anticipated cessation of telecommuting.

**3** Have the approved telecommuter return to their official work site.

**2** Complete the HR-305 Revocation of Telecommuting Authorization Form.

**4** Not approve any additional telecommuting days and/or revoke prior approved telecommuting days.

Individual telecommuting agreements may be suspended or terminated for any other reason at any time by the agency with thirty days' notice where feasible and consistent with agency operating needs. The telecommuter may suspend or withdraw from telecommuting at any time with prior notice to the supervisor.

Employees who have been removed from the Telecommuting Program may reapply for participation no sooner than six months from the date of removal.
