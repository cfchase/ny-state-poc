State government websites should only be used for official New York State business. Such websites should not be used to advertise for private individuals, firms, or corporations or imply in any manner that New York State endorses or favors any specific commercial product, commodity, or service. Similarly, State websites should not be used for political campaigning or other partisan activities, nor should they link to any political or campaign websites. Agencies should be especially careful when posting links to non-governmental websites such as vendor pages or news organization to ensure such links do not imply State endorsement.
