# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The Public Integrity Reform Act of 2011 established Project Sunlight, an initiative which authorized the creation of an online database (http://www.projectsunlight.ny.gov/) that the public can access to see the names of individuals and entities interacting with government decision makers and imposes reporting requirements on certain state employees ("covered employees"). The purpose of this policy is to communicate the mandatory nature of the Project Sunlight training and reporting requirements to covered employees.

## **2.0 Authority**

Section 1 of Executive Order No. 1171, issued January 2002, charges the State Chief Information Officer with overseeing and supervising the management and operations of the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS). Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.

## **3.0 Scope**

This policy applies to employees of ITS.
