Should a Non-ITS Employee request the use of a State Vehicle for the purpose of providing a service to the State, the following steps must be completed:

**1** The Requestor must submit a Request for Non-ITS Employee Use of ITS Vehicles Form ("the Form") requesting the use of a State vehicle. The Requestor and/or Requestor's agents, employees, officers, partners, or subcontractors, if any, shall have completed the ITS onboarding process.

**2** The ITS program staff overseeing the Requestor's work will review the Form and determine whether the use of a State vehicle may be permitted by analyzing the request and whether suitable alternatives are available.

**3** PaCS staff shall then confirm that the applicable insurances required by the ITS, or other State Agency's (e.g., OGS) contract are on file and valid.

**4** The ITS Division of Legal Affairs will then review the Form and all documentation, seek further documentation as needed, and provide a recommendation to the CIO.

**5** Facilities staff will then have the Requestors supervisor and the Non-ITS Employee complete and return the Fleet Vehicle New Driver Agreement Form. Upon LENS approval, Facilities will forward the request to the CIO for final approval.

**6** The CIO may either approve or disapprove the request, with or without cause. If the CIO does not act upon the request within fifteen (15) business days, such request will be deemed as denied.

**7** The Form will be returned to Facilities. Facilities will notify the applicable program staff, the PaCS unit, and Division of Legal Affairs of the outcome of the request, along with a copy of the approval.
