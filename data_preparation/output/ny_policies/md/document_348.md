For devices no longer needed, the Client Agency must promptly complete and submit an appropriate service request through the ITSM Service Catalog and ship the device to the address provided in ITSM. Before a Client Agency submits a request to offboard a user or replace a user's computing device, it should first consult with the Chief Legal Counsel of the Client Agency to ensure all legal preservation obligations are met.

Devices no longer in use by a Client Agency must be returned to ITS, unless directed otherwise by the Client Agency's Chief Legal Counsel due to legal preservation obligations.

## **4.7 Disposal**

Devices issued by or transferred to ITS are the property of ITS. At the end of a device's service life, devices must be disposed of by ITS. In the event that legal, operational, security, or other business needs require that a Client Agency retain the device past its useful operational life, ownership of the device must be transferred to that Client Agency.

At the time of disposal, ITS will sanitize all hard drive and storage devices under its control according to NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. It is the responsibility of the custodian to provide an accurate data classification prior to disposal. If ownership of the device is transferred to the Client Agency as outlined above, sanitization and disposal of the device will become the responsibility of the Client Agency.
