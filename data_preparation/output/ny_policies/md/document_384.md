# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

Social Security numbers (SSNs) are highly sensitive personal identifying information. SSNs are commonly used in identity theft and fraud. Changes to the New York State Labor Law and Public Officers Law in 2009 and 2010 implemented controls on the collection and transmission of SSNs by the State and its political subdivisions. These changes to the Labor Law and Public Officers Law reduce the potential for SSNs from being subject to unauthorized disclosure.

Since 1983, the New York State Personal Privacy Protection Law (PPPL), codified in Article 6-A of the Public Officers Law, has required State agencies to maintain in their records only the personal information relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of such agencies: (1) as required to be accomplished by statute or executive order, or (2) as required to implement a program specifically authorized by law. Further, the PPPL obligates agencies to ensure the integrity and security of personal information maintained in their records. Chapter 279 of the Laws of 2008 amended the PPPL and the Labor Law to extend to public entities certain prohibitions already applicable to commercial entities and to establish specific requirements applicable for the use and transmission of SSNs. More specifically, Chapter 279 added Section 96-a of the Public Officers Law and Section 203-d of the Labor Law.
