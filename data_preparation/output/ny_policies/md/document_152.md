| Surplus and Disposal of  ITS Equipment,  Furniture and Vehicles | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner:  Facilities Services |

# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

This policy outlines the process for the surplus and/or secure disposal of New York State (NYS) Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) owned or managed electronic equipment (E-equipment), furniture, miscellaneous equipment, and vehicles. This policy safeguards state assets, creates efficiency in surplusing or scrapping, maximizes the value received for property that is surplus to the State's needs, and is attentive to environmental impacts.

In order to effectively surplus and dispose of items no longer of use, and which have no value, the ITS surplus and disposal process has been established based on guidelines provided by the Office of General Services (OGS) and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.

## **2.0 Authority**

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering.
