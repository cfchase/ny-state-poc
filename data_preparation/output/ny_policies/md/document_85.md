The cost versus benefit of a sanitization process should be understood prior to a final decision. SEs can always increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable and indicated by an assessment of the existing risk. For example, even though Clear or Purge may be the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and verification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options. SEs may not decrease the level of sanitization required. If the SE has not identified the classification of information on media, the disposition should follow the sanitization method for confidential information.

## **Control of Media**

A factor influencing an SE sanitization decision is who has control and access to the media. This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media control may be transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being donated or resold to be reused outside the organization. The following are examples of media control:

## **Under SE Control:**

路 Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under SE control if contractual agreements are in place with the SE and the maintenance provider specifically provides for the confidentiality of the information.

路 Maintenance being performed on an SE's site, under the SE's supervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered under the control of the SE.

## **Not Under SE Control:**

路 Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes and where the specific media will not be returned to the SE are considered to be out of SE control.

路 Important Note: As data and assets of various types and classifications are established or migrated into the Cloud infrastructures of third-party hosting partners, this Standard will continue to apply. If data classified as High is to be stored with a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), the physical data storage must be destroyed after use, and the SE would need to ensure that the destruction was completed by the CSP and that proof of destruction was provided at that time.$_{ }$

## **Reuse of Media**

SEs should consider the cost versus benefit of reuse. It may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and verification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other sanitization options.

## **Clear / Purge / Destroy**

The table below gives a general explanation of the options for sanitization. Recommended sanitization techniques for specific types of media are outlined in NIST 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, Appendix A - Minimum Sanitization Recommendations.
