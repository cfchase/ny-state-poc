This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

An exception is required prior to implementing or deploying a technology solution that deviates from a technology policy, standard, or solution issued or provided by ITS. Additionally, certain technology standards may also be enforced through automated processes implemented through ITS's Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) system.

Technology exceptions may be granted by the ITS Chief Information Officer (CIO), or their designee, where compliance with a technology policy or standard is not feasible, or to deviate from utilizing an established enterprise technology service or an established technology solution when applicable to a required use case. Justification for technology exceptions is limited to:

路 Impending retirement of a system.

路 The total cost of ownership of the established service or solution exceeds the total cost of ownership of the proposed alternative.

Infeasibility to implement the policy, standard, or solution due to some limitation.

路 There is an elevated risk with the established service or solution based on the business context.

Exceptions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and their approval is not automatic. Exceptions that are granted will be for a specific period of time. Upon expiration of the exception, an extension of the exception may be requested, if it is still required.

The exception request must be submitted on a completed Exception Request Form and must include:

路 The description of the non-compliance or deviation
