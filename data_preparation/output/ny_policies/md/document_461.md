The supervisor may require an employee to submit a new telecommuting application if the employee leaves the current position or program area or if the employee's job duties or function significantly changes.

## **4.3.3 Renewal**

Telecommuters are required to retake the ITS Telecommuting Program training, How to Work Remotely training, and submit a new telecommuting application by July 1 annually, which marks the beginning of each new telecommuting period, to continue telecommuting.

## **4.3.4 Work Plan**

The supervisor will use the telecommuter's performance program, if applicable, in conjunction with current work assignments to define the performance and work productivity expectations for telecommuting days. The supervisor and telecommuter must discuss assignments and expectations (the "work plan") in advance of telecommuting and meet regularly to assess productivity and performance; adjustments to assignments and expectations should be made on an ongoing, as-needed basis. The supervisor shall ensure that the work plan is captured in writing in advance of, or no later than the start of, the telecommuting

period, and accessible to both the supervisor and the telecommuter. The telecommuter must provide documentation of all work performed while participating in this program upon supervisor request.

In addition to the above, for probationary employees, supervisors must include expectations for work deliverables, processes for training and coaching during telecommuting days, methods of observation or review of work performed including feedback, and frequency and expectation of in person check-ins in the work plan.

Supervisors are expected to provide ongoing feedback and monitor telecommuters closely, including evaluating completed work products for continued participation.

If productivity or performance on a telecommuting day is unsatisfactory, the supervisor/manager should complete the HR-304 Unsatisfactory Telecommuting Report Form, noting if there are issues with a telecommuter's productivity, responsiveness, workspace compliance, technology issues, or other reasons.
