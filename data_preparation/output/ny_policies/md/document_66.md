# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

During Critical Incidents; the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) is often faced with many requests from the Executive Chamber or ITS supported agencies (client agency) for work items to support emergency; crises; and disaster response. The typical Information Technology (IT) Governance processes utilizing the IT Investment Request Form; Agency Governance Boards, and Portfolio Executive Board for decisionmaking may not be well suited to support all response efforts during a Critical Incident or Governor's initiative related thereto For these   situations, ITS has created an expedited project and initiatives submission and approval process. This policy outlines the expedited project and initiative submission and approval process to serve as a repeatable process during Critical Incidents or Governor's initiatives related thereto.

## **2.0 Authority**

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies; including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 1171, established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer (CIO) with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies; protocols; and standards for State government,   including hardware, software, security; and business re-engineering .
