## **7. Perform Certification and Accreditation**

The information security plan must be analyzed, updated, and accepted by SE executive management. All systems and applications are required to undergo periodic risk assessments to ensure they reflect a security posture commensurate with each SEs definition of acceptable risk. Risk assessments must include assessments for compliance with all federal, state, and external compliance standards for which the SE is required to comply.

Risk assessments must be performed after all system and application changes, prior to deployment, and periodically as part of continuous system compliance monitoring.

## **8. Release & Maintenance Support**

As part of the SSDLC process, the regular upkeep of systems is an important task. Throughout the life cycle of a system or application the following items will need to be considered: regular risk assessment reviews, final network diagrams, attachments of final scans prior to deployment, patch management plans, schedules of continued planning, and plans for OS upgrades and hardware refresh. This is not an all-inclusive list; however, it is important to know that when the system goes live, the iterative nature of the SSDLC process continues throughout its life cycle.

A formal change management process must be followed whenever a system or application is modified in order to avoid direct or indirect negative impacts that the change might impose. The change management process must ensure that all SSDLC security activities are considered and performed, if relevant, and that all SSDLC security controls and documentation that are impacted by the change are updated.

## **9. System Disposal**

The information contained in systems and applications must be protected once a system or application has reached end of lifecycle and is no longer necessary to perform a SE function. Information must be retained, securely deleted or returned to the SE according to applicable federal and state mandates or other retention requirements. Information without retention requirements must be discarded or destroyed and all disposed media must be sanitized in accordance with applicable federal and state standards, including the NYS-S13-003: Sanitization Secure Disposal Standard, to remove residual information.
