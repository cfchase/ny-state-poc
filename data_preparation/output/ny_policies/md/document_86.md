| Clear  | One method to sanitize media is to use software or hardware products to overwrite  user- addressable storage space on the media with non-sensitive data, using the  standard read and write commands for the device. This process may include  overwriting not only the logical storage location of a file(s) (e.g., file allocationtable) but  also should include all user- addressable locations. The security goal of the overwriting  process is to replace Target Data with non-sensitive data. Overwriting cannot be used  for media that are damaged or not rewriteable and may not address all areas of the  device where sensitive data may be retained. The media type and size may also  influence whether overwriting is a suitable sanitization method. For example, flash  memory-based storage devices may contain spare cells and perform wear levelling,  making it infeasible for a user to sanitize all previous data using this approach because  thedevicemay notsupport directly addressingall areas wheresensitivedatahas been  stored using the native read and writeinterface. |
|        | The Clear operation may vary contextually for media other than dedicated storage  devices, where the device (such as a basic cell phone or a piece of office equipment)  only provides the ability to return the device to factory state (typically by simply deleting  the file pointers) and does not directly support the ability to rewrite or apply media- specific techniques to the non-volatile storage contents. Where rewriting is not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
