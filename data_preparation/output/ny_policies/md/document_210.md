The initial setup, software installation, system updates, patching, and security configuration of new systems must be performed in a secure environment isolated from other operational systems with minimal communication protocols enabled. Patch management must be implemented per the NYS-S15-001 Patch Management Standard.

Per the NYS-S13-001 Secure System Development Lifecycle Standard, Appendix B Item 3, SEs must maintain configuration management plans that define detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used in conjunction with secure system development life cycle activities at the system level. Configuration management plans must include a maintenance schedule to refine and update configurations and profiles to adhere to the latest industry standards and hardening guidelines. Refreshing profiles could be driven by an updated benchmark or from an SE's updated or new security requirements. Configuration management plans must be maintained throughout the system's lifespan.

A configuration monitoring process must be in place to ensure system integrity (e.g., identifying undiscovered or undocumented system components, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized changes).
