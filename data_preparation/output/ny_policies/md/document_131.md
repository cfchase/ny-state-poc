**15** For all forms of discrimination and harassment, if an employee, including an intern or contractor working in a State workplace, experiences sexual harassment or discrimination on the basis of their status as a victim of domestic or other gender-based violence, or observes discrimination in the workplace, the employee may file a complaint to OER via the New York State Employee Discrimination Complaint form located at www.oer.ny.gov, or by contacting an equal employment officer.

**14** Every employer in New York State must have a policy on sexual harassment prevention, which includes a procedure for the receipt and investigation of complaints of sexual harassment. This policy and procedure should be distributed to new employees and made available to all staff regularly. ITS's sexual harassment and discrimination policy is the New York State Equal Employment Opportunity Handbook which may be found at EEO handbook here:https://oer.ny.gov/equal-employment-opportunity-rights-andresponsibilities-handbook-employees-new-york-state-agencies

**16** Any complaint of potential discrimination, whether verbal or written, must be investigated by OER. Furthermore, any supervisory or managerial employee who observes or otherwise becomes aware of conduct of a sexually harassing nature must report such conduct to OER so that it can be investigated. The confidentiality of the complainant shall be maintained to the extent practical.

## **4.4 Non-Retaliation Policy**

ITS shall not engage in any retaliatory practices against any employee that discloses they are a victim of domestic or gender-based violence, or any employee seeking accommodations or to exercise their rights under this policy.

ITS will not retaliate, tolerate retaliation by any superiors, terminate, or discipline any employees for reporting information about alleged incidents of domestic violence that may have been committed by an employee, including those in management positions.
