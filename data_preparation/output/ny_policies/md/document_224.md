**14**Parking tickets, permits, or placards that grant special parking privileges for State Vehicles may be used only for official business.

**15**The driver of a State Vehicle shall be personally responsible for all parking, moving, and E-Z Pass violations.

**16**Unless expressly authorized by ITS, no banners, advertising, placards, decals, or stickers may be placed on a State Vehicle.

## **4.5 Use of Drivers**

An ITS employee may have an ITS-approved driver drive the ITS employee in an ITS State Vehicle for official business but driving another ITS employee cannot be the sole or primary duty of the ITS employee.

## **4.6 Vehicle Use Records**

**1** ITS Points of Contact (POC) maintain a State Vehicle Usage Record ("the Record") for each vehicle assigned to that location along with a calendar for booking.

**2** The Record requires any approved driver using a State vehicle to record at least the following information: Driver's name, dates and times of use, occupants of the vehicle, starting location and destination, purpose of the trip, starting and ending odometer readings, fuel and oil purchases, and driver's signature. Any personal use must be clearly identified as such in the record. Drivers are responsible for verifying the odometer reading before leaving and during each leg of the trip. Fuel and maintenance receipts must be attached to the Record except for personal use that is incidental to official business.

**3** Each leg of the trip must be separately recorded in the Record. For example, the approved user must record the trip from the official work location to the meeting and then from the meeting location back to the official work location.

**4** Each driver must complete all information in the Record for the day(s) used. Drivers must print and sign to certify that the record is a correct and accurate report of the vehicle usage.
