**i** Make a list of all Internet-related communications where the SE requires an individual to transmit his/her full SSN over the Internet in order to register for or file a claim for benefits or services, or where an individual is required to use his/her SSN to access the SE's Internet website.

**ii** Divide this list into two types of communications, i.e., SSN form submissions and SSNs used for website access.

## **iii. For these types of communications:**

· For both types of communications, unless required to do so by law, SEs are not permitted to require the transmission of the SSN unless the transmission is via a secure (i.e., https) connection or the SSN is encrypted.

· Unless required to do so by law, a SE is not permitted to require SSNs to be used to access internet websites unless a password, unique personal identifier, or other authentication device is also required. In those cases, in which SSNs are currently used for this purpose, a SE must:

o implement multi-factor authentication requiring a password, unique personal identifier, or other authentication device (e.g., a token) to establish the unique identity of the user; or

o provide users with a means of changing their user IDs from an SSN to an identifier that will not identify them personally and is not derived from the SSN. This notice could be provided to all current users of the SE's services in the next general postal or online mailing. For prospective users of the SE's services, any registration screen that asks for the creation of a user ID should contain a prominent disclaimer warning the individual to exercise care in the selection of a user ID with language such as " Choose an alias to protect your identity. Do not choose any information that identifies you personally (e.g., a Social Security number). "

Note that the NYS PPPL does not prevent the collection, use or release of a social security account number as required by state or federal law, or the use of a social security account number for internal verification, fraud investigation or administrative purposes.

A worksheet is attached to the end of this policy to further assist SEs complying with these laws. See Attachment A.
