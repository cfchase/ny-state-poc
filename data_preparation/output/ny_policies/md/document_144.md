# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

This Secure System Development Life Cycle (SSDLC) Standard defines security requirements that must be considered and addressed within every System Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

Computer systems and applications are developed/procured to address business needs. To do so effectively, system requirements must be identified early and addressed as part of the State Entity's (SE) SSDLC. Failure to identify a requirement until late in the process can have major repercussions to the success of a project and result in project delivery delays, deployment of an inadequate system, and even abandonment of the project. Furthermore, for each phase through which a project passes without identifying and addressing a requirement, the more costly and timeconsuming it will become to fix problems that occur due to the omission.

Information security must be adequately considered and built into every phase of the SE's SSDLC. Failure to address risks and implement proper controls can result in inadequate security, potentially putting SEs, and the State at large, at risk of data breaches, reputational damage, loss of public trust, compromise to systems/networks, financial penalties, and legal liability.
