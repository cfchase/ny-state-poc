## **4.3.1 E-Records General Concepts and Guidelines**

**4**3.1.1 Assessing Legal, Business, and Other Requirements: ESRA defines an "electronic record" as "information, evidencing any act, transaction, occurrence, event, or other activity, produced or stored by electronic means and capable of being accurately reproduced in forms perceptible by human sensory capabilities." This is consistent with definitions of "records" governing legally permissible court admission of, or disposition of, records (NYS Civil Practice Law and Rules ยง4518; NYS Arts & Cultural Affairs Law Article 57); and the NYS Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL" - Public Officers Law Art. 6, ยง86). Creation, format, and management of any types of records are often based on specific factors, so, in considering e-records, governmental entities should consult legal counsel and other appropriate staff to address if their existing recordkeeping practices are based on required legal mandates; business needs after an e-records system are developed; and past practices managing paper records.

A resource that NYS agencies and local governments (excluding New York City) can use in developing e-record systems is the NYS Archives (NYSA), which provides publications and advisory services concerning records retention, disposition, record management best practices, and archival requirements equally applicable to erecords as to paper documents. NYC agencies should consult with the NYC Department of Records and Information Services (DORIS) for similar information and guidance.
