**4**3.1.2 Basing E-records Management Measures on the Records' Value: As with paper, e-records produced or received by governmental entities are not all of equal importance or value. All government records should be maintained properly, but the effort used by a governmental entity to manage and maintain records, including e-records, should relate to the records' value to the agency and the citizens. Risk management requires deciding what best addresses risk after comparing risks to potential benefits and considering alternate measures to address them. When applying risk management principles to e-records, consider: if erecords were lost or unavailable, how would it impact entity operations, including the entity or others suffering financial loss; the likelihood the e-records would be subject or relevant to a legal action; an inability to produce the e-records in admissible form in court having a critical impact on a case's outcome; and, whether the e-records are needed for extended time periods, for business reasons or their significant cultural or historical value.

**4**3.1.3 Focusing on E-records Systems and Business Processes: To demonstrate e-record authenticity and integrity, the reliability and accuracy of the systems, processes, and procedures producing and maintaining them are critical, and more important than the format, medium, or technology used. Governmental

entities should identify, specify, and document their processes and procedures if they expect their e-records to be accepted in legal and other proceedings.

**4**3.1.4 E-records training: Training about systems used to create and retain erecords helps staff adequately maintain and preserve e-record authenticity, integrity, and legal admissibility, and awareness of: the fragile media on which they are stored; technology platforms needed to access and use them; and ensuring their admissibility in legal proceedings, and accessibility throughout their legal retention periods.
