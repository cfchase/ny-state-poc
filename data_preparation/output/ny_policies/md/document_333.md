## **4.4.8 How does the SE protect the confidentiality and integrity of information it collects through the website?**

Describe, in general terms, the manner in which the SE protects the confidentiality and integrity of information collected through its website. The SE's description should not, however, disclose information that would jeopardize its ability to maintain the security of its information technology assets. For example:

"The Agency recognizes the need to protect personal information and private information collected through this website against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The Agency limits employee access to personal information and private information collected through this website to those employees who need access to the information to perform their official duties. Employees with access to such information are made aware of the need to follow appropriate procedures in connection with any disclosure of that information, and the state agency must adhere to applicable State information security policies available at https://its.ny.gov/policies

The Agency has implemented procedures to safeguard the integrity of its information technology assets, including, but not limited to, authenticating, monitoring, auditing, and encrypting. Security procedures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day operations of this website as part of our continuing commitment to the security of electronic content as well as the electronic transmission of information.

For website security purposes and to maintain the availability of the website for all users, the Agency employs software to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise damage this website.
