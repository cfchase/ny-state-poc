**4** APs and other supporting wireless devices must be placed in physically protected locations that minimize the opportunity for theft, damage, or unauthorized access.

**5** Wireless network coverage must be managed to restrict the ability to connect outside of the SE-approved boundary.

**6** The SSID of 802.11 wireless networks must be changed from the factory default setting.

**7** The SSID must not include information that indicates the location, technology, or manufacturer details of the wireless network (e.g., Server-Rm-WiFi-Access, WifiRm70 and Cisco-2400-WiFi). The SSID also must not include information that indicates the type of data traversing the network.

**8** A wireless Intrusion Detection System (IDS) must be utilized on all SE internal wireless networks.

**9** Public wireless networks (authenticated and non-authenticated) must be, at a minimum, physically separated from the internal wireless network or configured to tunnel to a secure endpoint outside the internal wireless network. The design must be included in the documented security plan.

**10** Logical addressing schemas must be used for public wireless (authenticated and non-authenticated), internal wireless, and wired networks in order to effectively distinguish client connections between them.

**11** While servers and information stores may be accessible over a wireless network, they must not directly connect to any wireless network.

**12** APs on public authenticated or internal wireless networks must be configured to provide the strongest encryption settings available. At a minimum, Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) 2 - Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) must be utilized.

**13** WPA2 personal mode must not be used for SE internal wireless networks.

**14** WPA2 personal mode, with Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPS) disabled, may be used for public authenticated access points that do not connect to SE internal wireless networks.
