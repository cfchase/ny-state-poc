The Alternate Work Site must be located within New York State or within a geographic location proximate to the work site such that the employee can report to the work site within a reasonable period of time when required by the supervisor, unless otherwise approved by the Chief Information Officer, or their designee following approval from the employee's supervisory chain up to and including the Division Executive. A telecommuter must notify the supervisor if the Alternate Work Site changes during the course of the telecommuting period.

Supervisors should consider the following factors when approving a request to telecommute from an Alternative Work Site outside of New York State:

**1** The length of time necessary for the telecommuter to report on-site on short notice;

**3** The impact of events requiring an on-site presence, within the unit's responsibilities, on ITS operations;

**2** The nature of the telecommuter's duties within the unit; including, but not limited to, the impact of the telecommuter's off-site presence on operations;

**4** The frequency of occurrence of events, within the unit's responsibilities, requiring an on-site presence;

**5** Whether the telecommuter resides in a border state (i.e., New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, or Pennsylvania).

The telecommuter is responsible for arranging a dedicated private workspace at the Alternate Work Site. The workspace must have:

**1** Equipment and supplies appropriate to conduct official business.

**3** Appropriate security measures to safeguard confidential information that the telecommuter will have access to as part of the telecommuter's job duties.

**2** Appropriate means of communication to complete the job duties.

**4** A safe work environment.

With cause, ITS may access the Alternate Work Site for reasons such as safety and security concerns or to retrieve state records or property. ITS will provide the telecommuter with notice of the reason for, and the date of, the visit at least 48 hours in advance unless agency management determines there are exigent circumstances requiring less notice in which case as much notice as feasible will be provided.
