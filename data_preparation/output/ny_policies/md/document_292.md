E-records are created in many ways: internally or using an online application, or received electronically, 6 and must be produced in the required form, with required informational content, unique identifiers, and contextual elements (e.g., authorizations, date stamps, e-signatures). Use precautions in transmitting/receiving e-records to prevent unauthorized persons from tampering with or corrupting them, compromising the e-records' authenticity and integrity. No matter how produced, erecords must be stored in secure recordkeeping systems.

## **Producing E-records:**

## **4.3.2.1 Compliance with Legal or Other Requirements:**

Document clear procedures for e-record receipt, creation, and storage : Documented policies and procedures should describe acceptable record formats, the point at which a transaction is completed, and specify how the e-record is securely stored so it cannot be modified without detection.

Designate a receiving device : ESRA regulation 9 NYCRR Part 540.5(e) requires governmental entities to designate the receiving "device" where e-records will be accepted, which could mean a specific server, e-mail address, or website. Entities should inform the public of those devices they have designated to receive e-records.

Establish controls for the accuracy and timeliness of input and output : The accuracy and timeliness of the input and output of systems is critical to demonstrating the integrity and authenticity of the e-records produced by a system.

**4**3.2.2 Authenticating e-Record senders and preventing alteration: To authenticate senders and determine the integrity of each type of e-record, establish policies and procedures driven by the potential risk and costs if the records were tampered with, inappropriately disclosed, or otherwise proven deficient. Establishing measures to secure e-records and their integrity during transmission and processing will vary with the level of risk, the business requirements, and the technology used. Examples may include Public Key Cryptography, which provides a very strong encryption for higher risk transactions; Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), a
