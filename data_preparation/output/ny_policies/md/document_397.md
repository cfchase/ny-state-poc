## **3.0 Scope**

This policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, interns, and ITS supported agencies ("Client Agency").

## **4.0 Information Statement**

Effective as of the date of this policy, ITS, in conjunction with the NYS Division of Budget ("DOB") and the Office of State Operations, will manage the State's mobile technology spending and provisioning in accordance with the guidelines established herein. The intent of this Policy is to provide ITS' Client Agencies access to the mobile devices and services necessary to keep up with current technology trends, support user needs and Client Agency missions, and ensure the appropriate use and efficacy of State resources.

A baseline for the number of mobile devices by type provisioned to each Client Agency will be set based on carrier records as of March 31, 2020. Going forward, any devices added that exceed that device type's baseline will be addressed via direct bill on a monthly basis. Requests for additional devices must be submitted to ITS through the Enterprise IT Service Management System (ITSM) service catalog.
