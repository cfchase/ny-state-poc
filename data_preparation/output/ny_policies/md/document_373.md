The State Employees Federated Appeal ("SEFA") is a State-sponsored program to allow staff to make charitable gifts as part of their payroll deductions. ITS encourages employee participation in SEFA, but consistent with this guidance, participation in SEFA is an individual choice which should be made without coercion. Employees are free to participate or not and are free to select to support a charity of their choice from the wide variety available. Other State or Agency sponsored events may include food or clothing drives, blood drives, and other events. Employees are encouraged, but not required, to participate in these events.
