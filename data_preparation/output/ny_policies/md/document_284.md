"[E]xecuted or adopted by a person with intent to sign the record.": Generally, a signature is a ceremonial act identifying the signer and conveying a commitment to carry out stipulations in the signed document. Under ESRA, while e-signatures must show the same intent as signatures affixed by hand, ESRA doesn't require any specific level or method of signer identification ("ID") or authentication, so government entities are free to select such methods as meet their needs. Selecting an appropriate identification and authentication approach is one consideration in selecting an esignature solution.

A signer's intent can be captured in many ways, such as automatically captured and documented by the signer's actions after entering an information system. But to avoid confusion as to signer intent, rather than rely solely on system recordation, government entities might adopt a number of other simple practices:

· Prior to applying an e-signature, afford the signer an opportunity to review the entire document or content to be signed.

· Format e-signed records to contain similar signature elements as in paper records so a reader may readily identify the significance of the signature at the bottom.

· Make it impossible for an e-signature to be applied to a document without the signer having been informed that a signature is being applied.

· Allow the signer's intent to be expressed as part of the record or in a certification statement submitted with and linked to the signed record.

· Record the date, time, and fact that the signer indicated their intent and retain this information for evidentiary purposes. This may be different than the time the signer accessed the application or was authenticated.

· Require the signer to act affirmatively to indicate assent to the document being signed, such as requiring the signer to click an "Accept" button, choose between that and a "Reject" button to show that a choice was made, or alternately be required to type specific words of acceptance (e.g., "I ACCEPT" or "I AGREE").

Below is an example of a generic signature attestation/affirmation statement that can be modified for use with specific e-signature applications.
