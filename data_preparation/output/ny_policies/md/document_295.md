## **4.3.3.2 Retain E-records Accessibly for their Legal Minimum Retention Periods:**

Use law-compliant records retention and disposition schedules: NYSA records retention and disposition schedules address general functions of NYS agencies and non-NYC local governments, but consulting NYSA's website and following NYSA's procedures, can develop schedules for unique records, including e-records. 7

Plan for covering data backup, disaster recovery, and emergency operations : Contingency plans helping governmental entities quickly restore systems after a disaster should include data backup and recovery to prevent loss of e-records.

Implement media controls: Physical and environmental threats can impact erecords, especially those stored on fragile data storage devices. Provide control over the many forms of physical data storage through standard labeling and tracking log practices and ensuring backup data storage devices are stored in environmentally and physically controlled locations. The extent of media control depends on the type of data, quantity of media, and the nature of the user environment. Media storing critical or high-risk e-records will normally demand higher levels of control than other data. 8

Perform routine backups: Software and data including e-records require backups, whose frequency depends on how often data changes and the importance of the changes. Consult program managers to determine appropriate backup schedules. Externally securely store and test backup copies to ensure they remain usable.

Make e-records retrievable during their retention periods but destroyable thereafter: Use adequate indexing and search tools allowing retrieval when erecords are stored on nearline or physical data storage devices. But e-records having met their legal retention requirements and serving no other business needs should be destroyed. Destruction involves controlling all copies on all computers, detachable equipment, and media; documenting destruction; and using appropriate media sanitization and destruction methods depending on the e-records' confidentiality. 9
