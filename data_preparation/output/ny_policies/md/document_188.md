[8] Is the information (e.g., financial transactions, performance appraisals) relied upon to make business decisions? If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of that information.

Example(s): It is important for financial information to remain reliable. Unauthorized changes to financial transactions (e.g., direct deposit, electronic funds transfer) could severely impact the financial stability of a State Entity.

Employee appraisal records are used to make important personnel decisions. Someone may attempt to falsify records in hopes of getting a promotion, alternate employment, or to diminish someone else's reputation and/or record. The impact to the State Entity could vary dependent upon the situation.

## **Availability Questions**

[1] This information needs to be provided or available:

· As time permits

· 24 hrs. per day/7 days a week

Within 1 to 7 days

Example(s): Intrusion detection systems send event notifications so that an incident can be analyzed and escalated based on the level of threat. Since security is critical, and severe damage can be caused to State Entity data and networks, this operation is time critical and requires high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week).

[2] What is the impact to health and safety if information were not available when needed?

Example(s): Medical records contain information (e.g., allergies, blood type, previous medications) which is critical for providing patients with accurate medical care. Lack of availability to this data during emergency medical care can lead to life threatening situations therefore placing these items in the high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week) category.

[3] What is the financial impact if information were not available when needed?

Example(s): For any State Entity where online services generate revenue, a disruption of service can have a financial impact which could be deemed severe.

A personal computer system crash which can be solved by a simple reboot would have limited impact.

[4] What is the impact to the SE mission if information were not available when needed?

Example(s): Public transportation's mission is to get customers quickly and efficiently to various locations. If access to train, bus, and subway schedules was unavailable, this could lead to an inability of public transportation to fulfill its mission. The impact to its mission would be severe.

[5] What is the impact to the public trust if the information were not available when needed?

Example(s): State Entities have spent considerable effort modernizing operations to include online services and encouraging the public to use these services. If these services were seriously degraded or disrupted, this could cause serious embarrassment to the State Entity resulting in a severe impact and an erosion of the public's trust in the SE and the online services. The availability, in this case, would be categorized as high.
