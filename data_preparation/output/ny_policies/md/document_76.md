Vendors provide a "Security Policy" as part of their module or product validation. This "Security Policy" can be found under the Cryptographic Module column on the CMVP list. The "Security Policy" will provide information on how to configure the module in a FIPS mode of operation and how the module functions to meet the FIPS requirements.

## **Modules in Process**

NIST maintains a Modules in Process list. Inclusion on the list is at the option of the vendor. Posting on this list does not imply a guarantee of final FIPS validation. Therefore, SEs that deploy a module before it is validated incur a level of risk in that the module may never be validated, or the version submitted for testing is not the version that is validated.
