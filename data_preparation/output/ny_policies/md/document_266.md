· The frequency of risk assessments.

How risk assessment information is collected; and

Risk assessments can be conducted at any of the organizational tiers, each with different objectives and outputs. Tier 1 and 2 risk assessments should be performed, at a minimum, annually, per the NYS-P03-002 NYS Information Security Policy. Risk assessments conducted at one tier can inform threat, vulnerability, likelihood, and impact information used in assessments conducted at other tiers.

## **Tier 1 - SE Organizational Level Risk Assessments:**

· Support organizational strategies, policies, guidance, and processes for managing risk;

Can be based solely on the assumptions, constraints, risk tolerances, priorities, and trade-offs established in the risk framing step; and

· Focus on SE organizational operations, assets, and individuals;

· Consider the identification of mission-essential functions from Continuity of Operations Plans (COOP) prepared by the SE and relevant third parties when determining the contribution of Tier 2 risks.

## **Tier 2 - Mission/Business Process Level Risk Assessments:**

· Conducted across multiple mission/business functions;

· Inform decisions for how and when to use information systems for specific mission/business processes, including supporting mission/business processes in the event of a system compromise;

· Support control selection for mission/business processes, resiliency requirements, and the implementation of those requirements in the enterprise architecture;

· Align with the development of Business Continuity Plans (BCP); and

· Focus on mission/business segments, with varying degrees of criticality and/or sensitivity to core organizational mission/business functions.

Tier 3 - Information System Level Risk Assessments:

· Conducted for each system and reviewed at each phase of the secure system development lifecycle (SSDLC) as outlined in the NYS-S13-001 Secure System Development Life Cycle Standard;
