Information security risk management activities also occur at multiple layers within an organization, each providing different components to a consistent risk management program. For the purposes of this document, these layers, or "tiers," are separated as follows: Organization, Mission/Business Processes, and Information Systems. Table 1 defines and provides sample activities for each tier.

| Tier 1:  Organization  level             | Establishes the risk  management program and  provides context for risk-related  activities at lower tiers. The  organization tier activities often  include SE executive staff and  other relevant decision makers  to provide strategic guidance to  SE staff. | · Establish SE risk  management function  · Define SE risk tolerance  · Prioritize mission/business  functions                                                                                            |
| Tier 2:  Mission/Business  Process level | Focuses on the processes  required to support  mission/business functions  defined at Tier 1. Activities at  Tier 2 are informed by the  strategic vision outlined at Tier  1 and inform subsequent risk  management processes at Tier  3.                       | · Define and prioritize  mission/business processes  · Identify and classify data  necessary for  mission/business functions  · Establish enterprise  architecture in support of  Tier 1 strategic vision |
| Tier 3:  Information  System level       | Risk management activities  associated with a specific  information system.                                                                                                                                                                                      | · Identify and implement  security controls for the  system  · Manage secure system  development life cycle  (SSDLC) activities                                                                           |
