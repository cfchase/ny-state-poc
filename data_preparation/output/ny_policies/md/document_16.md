| Provides some assurance that the individual authenticating is in control of  an authenticator bound to the individual's account. Requiresat least single- factor authentication. For example, aperson logging in with a username and  password (or smart card, biometrics, etc.) would meet this requirement.  Successful authentication requires that the individual logging in prove  possession and control of the authenticator through a secure authentication  protocol as defined in the NYS-S14-006 Authentication Tokens Standard | AAL1                                |
| Provides high confidence that the individual authenticating is in control of  an authenticator(s) bound to the individual's account. Requires at least two  distinct authentication factors (multi-factor). For example, a person logging  in with a username and password (i.e., something you know) and a  hardware/software token (i.e., something you have) would meet this  requirement. For additional information on acceptable authentication  factors, please see NYS-S14-006 Authentication Tokens Standard.                     | AAL2                                |

Appendix D outlines the process to be used by an SE to determine the risk of improperly validated access or potential data exposure. By understanding these risks, the SE is better able to determine the required AAL and the corresponding authentication technology.

## **4.3 Federation and Assertions**

Federation refers to the linking of an individual's identity in one system to that same individual's identity in other systems. Federation allows the results of authentication processes and relevant identity information to be shared and trusted across networked applications or systems. Federated identity systems use assertions to accomplish this task. Assertions are declarations from an Identity Provider (IdP) to an RP that contain information about an individual. Even when full identification is necessary, SEs must only collect the minimum amount of personal information required and must not identify the individual in an assertion.

FAL categories reflect the options SEs can select based on their risk tolerance and the assessment of potential harm caused by an attacker taking control of federated transactions.

| FAL1                             | Allows for the system to access an identity assertion from a  separately administered IdP; the SE system will trust that the third-party  system has identified and authenticated the individual to the degree  claimed. FAL1 maps to the OpenID Connect Basic Client profile or  Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Web Single Sign On (SSO)  Artifact Binding profile with no additional features. |
