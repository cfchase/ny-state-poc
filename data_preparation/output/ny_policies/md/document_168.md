Users should be sensitive to the fact that information posted on social media sites clearly reflects on the individual and may also reflect on the individual's professional life. Consequently, users should use discretion when posting information on these sites and be conscious of the potential perceptions of and responses to the information. It is important to remember that once information is posted on a social media site, it can be captured and used in ways not originally intended. It is nearly impossible to retract, as it often lives on in copies, archives, backups, and memory cache.

Users should carefully consider whether to post information about their employment on personal social media sites, including which SE they work for and their job title, as such information could be used for purposes of committing fraud, identity theft, phishing, or other cyber exploits.

Users should follow best practices when using social media in a personal capacity, including the following:

· Be familiar with your SE's policy on the use of any images, logos or information related to the performance of official duties or as a result of State employment.

· Respect the privacy of your State colleagues and do not post any identifying information of any staff without permission (including, but not limited to, names, addresses, photos, videos, email addresses, and phone numbers). Users may be held liable for comments posted on social media sites.

· If a personal email, posting, or other electronic message could be construed to be an official communication, a disclaimer is strongly recommended, such as, "The views and opinions expressed are those of the author and are not authorized by and do not necessarily reflect those of [your Agency] or the State of New York."

· Ensure the passwords used for your personal social media sites are different from those used on SE IT equipment and resources in order to prevent unauthorized access to SE equipment and IT resources if the personal password is compromised.

· Immediately consult your SE's information security officer/designated security representative for assistance in the event you suspect your personal social media account has been compromised in a way that may impact your technology use in your official capacity.

· If available on the platform, use the strongest multifactor authentication possible to secure your social media account as described in section 4.4.
