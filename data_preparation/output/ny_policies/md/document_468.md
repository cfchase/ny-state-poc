Telecommuters cannot invite third parties to their Alternate Work Site for purposes of conducting official business.

ITS is not liable for conditions at the Alternate Work Site which are found to violate local ordinances or regulations, or state or federal regulations or laws.

An employee is considered to be acting within the course and scope of

employment when engaged in job-related activities; therefore, Workers' Compensation benefits will apply to injuries arising out of, and in the course of, employment, regardless of whether the injury occurred on or off ITS premises. If an injury occurs while an employee is performing assigned duties at the Alternate Work Site under a telecommuting agreement, the employee is to follow established reporting procedures to report the injury and for filing a Workers' Compensation claim. The telecommuter must notify their supervisor immediately. The telecommuter will complete the ITS Accident Reporting Form and call the Accident Reporting System (ARS) at (888) 800-0029 to report the work-related injury. All claims for work-related injuries at the Alternate Work Site shall be subject to review and acceptance by the Workers' Compensation Board and the State Insurance Fund.
