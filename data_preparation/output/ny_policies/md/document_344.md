ITS provides workplace computing devices, select peripherals (i.e., keyboards, mouse, etc.), support, maintenance, and management services to deliver secure access to applications supporting Client Agency missions.

## **4.1 Device and Peripheral Standards and Selection**

The ITS Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) defines and maintains standardized device and peripheral categories. These standards are published in the Enterprise IT Service Management System (ITSM) Service Catalog and are designed to meet 90% of Client Agency device needs.

## **4.1.1 Device Categories and Funded Service Life Objectives**

Funded Service Life Objectives (FSLO) are the projected useful life of the device, starting on the procurement date of the device.

| Windows or Chrome OS Desktop | 4 years |
| Windows or Chrome OS Laptop  |         |

## **4.1.3 Exceptions**

Standardization is designed to broadly meet the needs of the user community in the most cost-effective way possible. Specialized use cases will be accommodated via an exception request and may require additional Client Agency funding.

Exception requests must include factors such as operational requirements or business need. An exception may be requested, via the ITSM Service Catalog, for approval by the ITS Chief Technology Officer, or their designee.
