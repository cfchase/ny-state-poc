# Title: **$^{ }$1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The purpose of this standard is to list the appropriate authentication tokens that can be used with systems developed or operated for New York State (NYS) that require authenticated access depending on the Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL). This document also provides the requirements for management of those authentication devices.

## **$^{ }$2.0 Authority**

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology Policies, Standards, and Guidelines

## **3.0 Scope**

This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

## **4.1 Assurance Levels and Required Token Types**

The AAL of a system determines the degree of certainty required when authenticating a user. The following table describes the level of confidence associated with each AAL. These levels of assurance are consistent with those established by the US Federal Government for use by federal agencies. For a full summary of AAL Requirements see Appendix A.
