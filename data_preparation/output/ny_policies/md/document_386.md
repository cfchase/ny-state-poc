This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. This guideline also applies to SE technology "systems," as defined in the NYS Information Technology Policies, Standards, and Best Practice Guidelines Glossary.
