**b** Except as described in the ITS Policy NYS-S14-013, Account Management/Access Control Standard, access to systems must be provided through the use of individually assigned, unique identifiers known as user-IDs.

**c** Associated with each user-ID is an authentication token (e.g., password, key fob, biometric) which must be used to authenticate the identity of the person or system requesting access.

**d** Automated techniques and controls must be implemented to lock a session and require authentication or re-authentication after a period of inactivity for any system where authentication is required. Information on the screen must be replaced with publicly viewable information (e.g., screen saver, blank screen, clock) during the session lock.

**e** Automated techniques and controls must be implemented to terminate a session after specific conditions are met as defined in NYS IT Policy NYS-S14-013, Account Management/Access Control Standard.

**f** Tokens used to authenticate a person or process must be treated as confidential and protected appropriately.

**g** Tokens must not be stored on paper, or in an electronic file, hand-held device, or browser, unless they can be stored securely and the method of storing (e.g., password vault) has been approved by the ISO/designated security representative.

**h** Information owners are responsible for determining who should have access to protected resources within their jurisdiction, and what those access privileges should be (e.g., read, update, etc.).

**i** Access privileges will be granted by the SE in accordance with the user's job responsibilities and will be limited only to those necessary to accomplish assigned tasks in accordance with SE missions and business functions (i.e., least privilege).

**j** Users of privileged accounts must use a separate, non-privileged account when performing normal business transactions (e.g., accessing the Internet, e-mail).
