Section 203(1) of the STL requires that each Internet privacy policy include, but not be limited to, the following elements:

(a) a statement of the information, including personal information , the State Agency Website will collect with respect to the user and the purposes for which the information will be used;

(b) the circumstances under which information, including personal information, collected may be disclosed ;

(c) whether any information collected will be retained by the SE, and, if so, the period of time that such information will be retained;

(e) the means by which information is collected and whether such collection occurs actively or passively;

(d) the procedures by which a user may gain access to the collected information pertaining to that user;

(f) whether the collection of information is voluntary or required, and the consequences, if any, of a refusal to provide the required information; and

(g) the steps being taken by the SE to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the information.

The elements may be addressed in any form and in any order deemed appropriate by the SE. Likewise, disclosure of the information required by a particular element may be combined with the information required by other elements. However, regardless of how the elements are organized, the information should be presented in a clear and logical manner.

Section 203(2) of the STL requires that the Internet privacy policy is posted on the State Agency Website, and that such posting "â€¦include a conspicuous and direct link to such privacy policy." ITS suggests that the required "conspicuous and direct link" is one that is identifiable, prominently displayed, easy to find, and used in a location or manner on the webpage that differs from the majority of the rest of the webpage's content by using a different font, color, background, formatting, or type size.
