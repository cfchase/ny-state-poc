# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

This standard outlines the general steps for responding to information security incidents. In addition to providing a standardized process flow, it (1) identifies the New York Stat e (NYS) incident response (IR) stakeholders and establishes their roles; (2) describes the process and activities through the IR process flow; (3) describes coordination with all relevant IR stakeholders and partners, and (4) provides examples of IR metrics for use in gauging IR effectiveness.

The goals of IR, as outlined in this standard, are to:

· Confirm whether an incident occurred;

· Provide a defined incident notification process;

· Promote the accumulation and documentation of accurate information;

· Contain the incident and halt any unwanted activity quickly and efficiently;

· Minimize disruption to operations;

· Provide accurate reports and useful recommendations to management and other stakeholders; and

· Prevent and/or mitigate future incidents from occurring.
