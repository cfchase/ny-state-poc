Benefits of incorporating date/time conversion warranty language into relevant information technology related contracts include:

· Enhanced resource utilization by remaining at the forefront of date/time conversion problems.

· Potential cost savings by incorporating the date/time conversion warranty now for other date/time conversion bugs, e.g., the "Unix Millennium 2038 Bug."

Benefits of being prepared for future date/time conversion issues include:
