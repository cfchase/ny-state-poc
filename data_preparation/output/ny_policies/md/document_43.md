Account management and access control includes the process of: requesting, creating, issuing, modifying, and disabling user accounts; enabling and disabling access to IT resources; establishing conditions for group and role membership; tracking accounts and their respective access authorizations; and managing these functions. An SE should carefully consider relevant rules and regulations, as well as the need and breadth of access, to carefully determine how to best protect its IT resources. An SE may need to create its own policies and procedures to implement the requirements of this standard.

## **4.1 Account Management and Access Control Roles**

Account management and access control require that the roles of Information Owner, Account Manager, and optionally, Account Administrator and Entitlement Administrator, are defined and assigned for each resource and application. A listing of authorized users in these roles must be documented and maintained by the SE. The associated tasks and responsibilities for each role are described below. Each role may belong to one or more individuals depending on the resource or application. In some cases, a single individual or group may be assigned more than one of these roles.

**a** Information Owners are people at the managerial level within an SE who:

· Define roles and groups, as well as the corresponding level of access to IT resources for that role or group;

· Delegate Account Managers to ensure the appropriate level of information access is provided. Delegation can be to individual users, groups, or third parties (e.g., another SE);

· Determine who should have access;

· Review that accounts and access controls are commensurate with overall business function and that the associated rights have been properly assigned annually, at a minimum; and

Determine the Identity Assurance Level (IAL) for the application or data via the NYS-P20-001: Digital Identity Policy;

· Require business units with access to protected IT resources to notify Account Managers when accounts are no longer required, such as when

users are terminated or transferred and when individual access requirements change.

**b** Account Managers maintain accounts and are the delegated custodians of SE protected data who:

· Determine the technical specifications needed to set access privileges;
