## **3.0 Scope**

This standard applies to all "State Entities" ("SE"), defined as "State Government" entities in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all other third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors), that use or access any ITS Information Technology Resource for which ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the ITS. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

This standard applies to all 802.11 wireless networks that store, process, or transmit SE information or connect to an SE network or system, including networks managed and hosted by third parties on behalf of the State.

The types of 802.11 wireless networks in scope include:

· Internal - these SE wireless networks are directly connected to the State's internal Information Technology Resources and are only available to authenticated users.

· Public (authenticated) - these SE wireless networks are not connected to the State's internal Information Technology Resources and access is limited to authenticated users.

· Public (non-authenticated) - these SE wireless networks are not connected to the State's internal Information Technology Resources and are available for anyone to use without authentication.
