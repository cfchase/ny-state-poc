[5] What impact does unauthorized release of sensitive information have on the SE mission?

Example(s): An SE may be charged with ensuring that illegal goods do not enter State borders. As part of that mission, the SE may be responsible for collecting and maintaining information regarding unmanned border crossings. If there was an unauthorized release of that information, resulting in an increase of illegal traffic across State borders, it could have a severe impact on the SE's ability to fulfill its mission.

An example of limited impact would be the release of employee contact information which may result in additional phone calls/emails/office visits.

If a list of local delivery restaurants and their phone numbers is disclosed, there would be no impact.

[6] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on the SE's intangible assets such as the public trust, agency reputation, and public interests?

Example(s): It is important for the government to maintain the public's trust. For example, the unauthorized exposure of medical records from a State-run facility could lead to a loss of the public trust in the State's ability to protect sensitive information.

An SE which collects and maintains the confidential records of citizens requires a high level of public trust. Unauthorized disclosure of data through the actions of a malicious insider, external hacker, or through a random accident could erode the public's trust in the SE and their ability to protect citizen data.

[7] Is confidentiality mandated by law or regulation? If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized disclosure of information.

Example(s): Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws or regulations. Disclosing this information can lead to civil or criminal liability. There are several key statutes, such as HIPAA, that should be examined based on the information asset being classified.

[8] Is the information intended for limited distribution? If yes, determine the impact of the unauthorized disclosure of that information.
