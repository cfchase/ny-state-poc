· Evaluate anticipated vulnerabilities and conditions affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability in the planned environments of operation; and

· Initial risk assessments (i.e., risk assessments performed for the first time, rather than updating prior risk assessments) should occur in the initial phase of system development, but can be performed at any phase in the system development life cycle;

· At a minimum, assessments must occur at system initiation, during system design, prior to transitioning the system to production, or after a significant change to the system.

Risk assessments must be maintained as part of the SE's risk monitoring program (e.g., changes in organizational information systems and environments may trigger a risk assessment review). Additional benefits to conducting regular risk assessments include:

· Current risk assessments ensure timely, relevant information that enables SE leadership to make informed, real-time risk management decisions;

· Reduced cost of future assessments and support of ongoing risk monitoring activities; and

· Reduces assessment scope. Incremental risk assessments consider only new information and differential risk assessments consider how changes affect the overall risk determination.

## **4.4 Risk Response**

Once a risk has been assessed, the SE must determine and implement the appropriate course of action. Options include:

**1** Risk Acceptance - This is a documented decision not to act on a specific risk at the time of assessment. Acceptance is not negligence or "inaction" and can be appropriate if the risk falls within the SE's defined risk tolerance. A risk acceptance response must be reviewed periodically as part of the requirements outlined in the risk monitoring section below. For example, choosing to accept the risk of an earthquake, based on the high cost of preventative controls and the low likelihood of occurrence of an earthquake in a given area.

**3** Risk Mitigation/Reduction - These are specific actions taken to eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level. This is the most common approach and is appropriate where controls can reduce the identified risk. For example, a firewall is installed to reduce the risk of network intrusion.
