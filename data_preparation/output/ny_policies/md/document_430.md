## **4.0 Information Statement**

The Cyber Incident Response Standard, NYS-S13-005, identifies Incident Response Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities and the Incident Response Process Flow. Each SE must assign responsibility for a central point of contact to coordinate identification of an incident and reporting an incident to the Enterprise Information Security Office.

In addition, the Information Security Policy, NYS-P03-002, details that SE executive management is responsible for: complying with notification requirements in the event of a breach of private information; adhering to specific legal and regulatory requirements related to information security; and communicating legal and regulatory requirements to the ISO/designated security representative.

The standards below set forth external notification and reporting requirements for some data types as required by the specific entities referenced herein, and are intended to assist SE executive management in meeting the responsibilities. Each SE should have documented procedures that reflect their compliance with applicable notification requirements, and should include specific names, titles, or functions of the individuals responsible for each stage of the notification process. The document should include detailed instructions for how, and to whom each employee, contractor, agent, or other third-party should report the incident. Any external notification and reporting from a SE to an external entity should only occur

pursuant to their SE incident response protocol and after proper coordination with SE executive management, legal counsel, Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative, and other stakeholders as appropriate.
