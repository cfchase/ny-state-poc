## **Exhibit A - User Controls for Protecting State Information**

The following are some examples of physical controls for handling media:

 No confidential information in e-mail subject line, as subject lines are not secure

o SE Privacy disclaimer on e- mail and fax cover sheets

 SE must include a statement that the contents are intended for the addressed recipient only and must be deleted/destroyed if received in error.

o Reproduction of data outside normal business functions requires authorization by information owner

o Retrieval when printing/faxing

 Users need to retrieve documents immediately or in a timely manner to protect from unintentional disclosure

o Transportation handling controls for paper both inside and outside the office

 Hand delivery by State Entity workforce or delivery via courier (e.g., OGS, FedEx, UPS, US Postal Service)

 Use sealed envelope addressed to specific recipient

 Where possible obtain receipt confirmation

o Situational awareness during verbal communications

 Be aware of surroundings when having discussions about HIGH classified information

o If choosing to label paper or portable electronic storage media, use the following: "NYS CONFIDENTIALITY-HIGH", "NYS CONFIDENTIALITY-MODERATE", "NYS CONFIDENTIALITY-LOW". This doesn't replace existing internal labeling structures, but must be included when labeling is used to facilitate the uniform application of controls when information is shared between State Entities. If document is not bound, label each page. Label front and back covers of bound documents.
