When encountering an issue concerning nepotism, employees must notify their immediate supervisor, and if no resolution is available, must seek guidance from the Ethics Officer before proceeding.

Employees are prohibited from: (1) participating in any decision to hire, promote, discipline, or discharge a relative; (2) awarding contracts to a relative; and/or (3) investing public funds in any security in which a relative has a financial interest. A "relative" is broadly defined as: (1) any person living in the same household as the employee (children, spouse, roommate, etc.); (2) any person who is a direct descendant of the employee's grandparent(s) (siblings, parents, uncles, aunts, or first cousins); or (3) the spouse of such a descendant (spouse of the employee's sibling, parent, uncle, aunt, or first cousin).

## **4.11 Restrictions Concerning Charitable Solicitations**

ITS employees may generally solicit for charitable donations in the workplace, so long as the restrictions laid out in this section are followed. Examples of acceptable charitable solicitations generally include: Girl Scout cookies, school candy sales, and monetary or participation sponsorships for races or events, with proceeds going to various charitable causes (specific restrictions apply to supervisors regarding these types of solicitations, discussed below in 4.11.B). This section only applies to charitable causes. Any form of sales or other marketing for non-charitable causes must comply with the requirements for outside activities in this policy.

Employees should consult with their supervisors prior to engaging in any solicitation for charitable causes. Supervisors may limit any activities that are deemed disruptive.
