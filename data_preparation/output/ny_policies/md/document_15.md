Identity proofing can occur either remotely or in-person in accordance with  the NYS-S20-001 Digital Identity Standard. A Credential Service Provider  (CSP) can validate the identity assurance level to the Relying Party (RP)  without providing identifying information of the individual.

As with IAL2, a CSP can validate the identity  assurance level to the RP without providing identifying information of the  individual.                                                                                                                    | IAL3                             |

Improper identification of individuals can result in direct and potentially dire consequences to the SE and individual consumers of NYS services, examples are provided in Appendix B. The SE's information owner must include the SE's information security officer

(ISO)/designated security representative in assurance assessments, both to assist with the process and to guide discussion regarding any final determinations. The SE's information owner is ultimately responsible for assigning the appropriate IAL for the system.

Appendix C outlines the process used by an SE to examine the data within its system and identify the risks of improperly validated access or potential data exposure. By understanding these risks, the SE is better able to determine the required IAL and the corresponding authentication technology.

## **4.2 Authentication**

A successful authentication provides a level of risk-based assurance that the individual accessing the service today is the same individual that previously accessed the service with that authenticator. The strength of this assurance is described by an AAL.

An AAL will define the appropriate authentication requirements based on the SE's risk tolerance and assessment of the potential harm caused by unauthorized access to SE systems and data.
