This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

The New York State Universal Navigation connects all NYS web sites to www.ny.gov both visually and interactively, enabling users to navigate government services from anywhere across the "NYS Web."

The Universal Navigation consists of header and footer navigation menus for use on SE public web sites. The Universal Navigation elements are to be placed on all SE public web sites and web applications as defined below.

## **4.1 New York State Universal Navigation**

The official embeddable code of the Universal Navigation and implementation instructions are found on the New York State GitHub account in the "Universal Navigation" repository.

To accommodate web sites with requirements that limit the standard functionality of the Universal Navigation, multiple versions may be included in the repository. Be sure to use the appropriate version for your site or application, following the instructions specific to that version. Guidelines or instructions included in the repository should be considered an extension of this standard.

To aid in implementation, the repository also contains guidance, frequently asked questions, demo versions, and other resources.
