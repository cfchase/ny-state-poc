The funding and procurement of out-of-scope peripherals are the responsibility of the Client Agency. This includes Reasonable Accommodation requests that are for out-of-scope peripherals. ITS will use reasonable efforts to support peripherals and, where Client agency funding is available, ITS may incorporate Client Agency funded peripherals into device procurements to maximize value.

## **4.3 Device Replacement**

In the event that a device fails, the device will be repaired or replaced at the discretion of ITS. If a device is replaced, the replacement device will be materially similar in function and may be new, used, or refurbished.

Client Agency funded devices, supported by ITS, which are replaced outside of a warranty period must be funded by the Client Agency.

## **4.4 Lost or Stolen Devices**

In the event a device is lost, stolen, or otherwise unreturnable, the user or the user's supervisor must immediately notify ITS and their agency. ITS will confirm data encryption and update the statewide inventory, noting the device's status. The user must also consult their agency's Chief Legal Counsel regarding their agency's legal obligations related to a lost or stolen device, as well as compliance with the Office of the State Comptroller's Guide to Financial Operations Chapter XII.10.E - Reporting the Theft, Loss or Misuse of State Assets, if applicable. ITS does not report a Client Agency's lost or stolen device to the Office of the State Comptroller.
