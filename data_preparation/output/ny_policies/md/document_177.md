There is no single set of controls that addresses all security concerns in every situation. However, NIST Special Publication 800-53B - Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations identifies a generalized list of baseline controls for each security impact level. These controls must be evaluated, selected, and tailored to meet the security and business requirements of the SE. SEs must be aware that additional controls may also be required to meet any compliance requirements such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or IRS Publication 1075, if applicable.

## **5.0 Compliance**

If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, SEs shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Office exception process.
