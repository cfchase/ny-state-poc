## **4.2.4 Eradication& Recovery**

Eradication involves removing elements of the compromise from the environment. Specific eradication measures depend on the type of incident, number of systems involved, and the types of operating systems and applications involved. Typical eradication measures include reimaging infected systems and enhanced monitoring of system activity. This allows for the return to normal operations.

Analysis of information collected is an iterative process and occurs/reoccurs during both the containment and eradication phases.

## **Activities**

**1** Remediating all infected IT environments

**2** Reimaging affected systems

**3** Rebuilding hardware

**4** Replacing compromised files

**5** Patching

**6** Resetting passwords

**7** Monitoring

**8** Developing response scenarios

**9** Allow time for clearing of all possible threats

## **4.2.5 Recovery**

Recovery involves restoring systems to normal operations and confirming that they are functioning normally. The main challenges of this phase are confirming that remediation has been successful, rebuilding systems, reconnecting networks, and recreating or correcting information.

## **Activities**

**1** Reconnecting to networks

**2** Tightening perimeter security

**3** Testing

**4** Monitoring

## **4.2.6 Post-Incident**

The goal of this phase is to document the incident, inform SE leadership, harden the environment to prevent similar incidents, and apply lessons learned to improve the handling of future incidents.

## **Activities**

**1** Adjust Sensors, Alerts, and Log Collection
