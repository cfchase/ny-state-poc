## **4.3 Incidental and Necessary Personal Use**

· is otherwise consistent with this policy and the requirements of Executive Order No. 7 3 , Prohibition Against Personal Use of State Property , established June 2008;

· is limited in frequency and duration;

· does not conflict with the proper exercise of duties of the user; and

Exercising good judgment regarding incidental and necessary personal use is important. SEs may revoke or limit this privilege at any time.
