Concurrent to notifying TIGTA, the agency must notify the Office of Safeguards by email to Safeguards mailbox, safeguardreports@irs.gov. To notify the Office of Safeguards, the agency must document the specifics of the incident known at that time into a data incident report, including but not limited to:

· Name of agency and agency Point of Contact for resolving data incident with contact information

· Date and time the incident occurred

· Date and time the incident was discovered

· How the incident was discovered

· Description of the incident and the data involved, including specific data elements, if known

· Potential number of FTI records involved; if unknown, provide a range if possible

· Address where the incident occurred

· IT involved (e.g., laptop, server, mainframe)

Reports must be sent electronically and encrypted via IRS-approved encryption techniques. Use the term data incident report in the subject line of the email. Do not include any FTI in the data Incident report.

Agencies are not to wait until after their own internal investigation has been conducted. Contacting TIGTA is critical to expedite the recovery of compromised data and identify potential criminal acts. The IRS Office of Safeguards investigation focuses on identifying processes, procedures or systems within the agency with inadequate security controls which led to the incident.
