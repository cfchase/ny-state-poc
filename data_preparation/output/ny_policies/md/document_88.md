SEs must test a representative sampling of media for proper sanitization to ensure that proper protection is maintained.

## **Verification of Equipment**

If the SE is using sanitization tools (e.g., a degausser), the SE must have procedures to ensure that the tools are operating effectively.

## **Verification of Personnel Competencies**

SEs must ensure that equipment operators are properly trained and competent to perform sanitization functions.

## **Document**

SEs must maintain a record of their sanitization to document what media were sanitized, when and how they were sanitized, and the final disposition of the media.
