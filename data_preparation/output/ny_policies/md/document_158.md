This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

NYS allows for remote access when there is a clear, documented business need. Access may be allowed from State-issued or personally-owned devices, at the discretion of the State Entities (SEs) and in accordance with the standards below. Such access must be limited to only those systems necessary for needed functions and be in compliance with SE's telecommuting policies and any applicable federal or state compliance requirements.

## **4.1 Approved Methods of Remote Access**

Approved methods of remote access to NYS systems are listed in order of preference.

**a** Portals - a server that offers access to one or more applications through a single centralized interface that provides authentication (e.g., web-based portal, virtual desktop interface (VDI)).

**b** Direct Application Access - accessing an application directly with the application providing its own security (e.g., webmail, https).

**c** Remote System Control - controlling a system remotely from a location other than the State's internal network.

**d** Tunneling - a secure communication channel through which information can be transmitted between networks (e.g., Virtual Private Network [VPN]).

## **4.2 Required Controls**
