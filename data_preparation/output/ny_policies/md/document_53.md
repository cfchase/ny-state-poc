This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any ITS resource for which ITS the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the ITS SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

This standard covers all systems and software developed for the SE, including but not limited to mobile, web, desktop, database, or mainframe regardless of their current system life cycle phase. This includes all test, quality control, production, and other adhoc systems that exist within or external to the State network. This standard equally applies to SE systems that are developed by third-party entities with or without the participation of State development staff. It is the responsibility of the SE to ensure vendor supplied software, including custom or commercial off-the-shelf (COTS), is built securely.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

As per the NYS-P03-002 NYS Information Security Policy, all software written for or deployed on SE systems must incorporate secure coding practices to avoid the occurrence of common coding vulnerabilities and to be resilient to high-risk threats before being deployed in production.

## **4.1 Secure Coding Practices**

The development process must use secure coding practices and follow the NYS-S13001 Secure System Development Life Cycle Standard.

These secure coding practices can include, but are not limited to the following list:

· Identify security requirements upfront in the development life cycle and make sure that subsequent development artifacts are evaluated for compliance with those requirements.

· Anticipate threats to which the software will be subjected and then develop threat mitigation strategies that address those threats.
