# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

Security risk management is a critical component of any information security program. It helps ensure that risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an organization's systems and data are identified, analyzed, and monitored. Information security risk management activities must be integrated into State Entity (SE) processes to provide governance and ensure consistent responses to identified risks at all levels of the organization.

The security of New York State (NYS) and SE assets such as personal, private, and sensitive information (PPSI) is essential. This Standard provides the minimum requirements for an SE's risk management program that frames, assesses, responds to, and monitors mitigation of organizational risk.
