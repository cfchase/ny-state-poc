including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## **3.0 Scope**

This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any Information Technology (IT) Resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this standard and an SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.

This standard covers all systems and applications developed/procured for New York State Entities (SEs), regardless of their current system life cycle phase. This includes all test, quality control, production and other ad-hoc systems that exist within or external to SE networks. This standard equally applies to systems developed by SE staff or by any third parties on behalf of the SE.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

Per the NYS-P03-002: Information Security Policy, SEs must ensure an SSDLC is utilized in the development of all SE applications and systems, including applications and systems developed on behalf of SEs by contracted third-party partners.
