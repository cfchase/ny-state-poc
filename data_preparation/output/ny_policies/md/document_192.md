# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

This policy sets forth the process for establishing technology standards for NYS government entities that receive information technology services from the New York State Office of Information Technology Services (ITS). Technology standards establish boundaries for technology usage, specifying technology to be used ("acceptable" use) and restricting access to technology that is deemed " exception " or non-standard.

## **2.0 Authority**

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines
