Client verification is often required when a visa holder is renewing their specific visa or traveling overseas. USCIS or the U.S. Department of State requires documentation of client verification as evidence that the visa holder is providing services as stated in their visa renewal petition or travel documents, respectively. The following are the steps required for requesting and obtaining approval of client verification documentation from the ITS Division of Legal Affairs ("DLA").

## **4.1.1 Notification of Need**

ITS employees must notify DLA as soon as practicable after they receive a request for client verification information. Notifications must be sent to its.sm.dla@its.ny.gov and must contain the following information:

路 Contractor's/consultant's name.

路 Requestor name and organization ( e.g. , USCIS), including contact information.

Contractor's/consultant's ITS supervisor's/manager's name.

路 If from the contractor's/consultant's direct employer, a detailed statement of need for the request.

路 If from a government entity, a copy of the notice requesting additional evidence.

DLA will only process requests from a government entity or an employer, not a contractor or a consultant. DLA may require additional information to process the request.

## **4.1.2 Client Verification Information**

Client verification information must not be released without prior consultation with and approval by DLA. Such client verification information may include but is not limited to whether a contractor/consultant performs services for ITS; when a contractor/consultant had performed services for ITS; and the name of the vendor employing the contractor/consultant.

## **4.1.3 Communication of Verification**

Under no circumstances should an ITS employee provide client verification information to the requestor without consultation with DLA. Further, no

contractor/consultant may be provided their own client verification information unless required by law, rule, or regulation.

## **4.1.4 Governmental Entity**
