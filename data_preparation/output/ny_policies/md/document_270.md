| Moderate            | 21-79                       | 5                           | · Adversary is somewhat likely to initiate the threat  event.  · The threat event is somewhat likely to have adverse  impacts.  · Errors, accidents, or acts of nature may occur 1-10  times per year.                    |

The threat event is unlikely to have adverse impacts.  · Errors, accidents, or acts of nature may occur less  than once per year but more than once per ten years. |

The threat event is highly unlikely to have adverse  impacts.  · Errors, accidents, or acts of nature may occur less  than once per ten years.              |
