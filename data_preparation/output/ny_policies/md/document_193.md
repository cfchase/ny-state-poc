This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

The standards outlined here most often relate to the hardware and software products allocated to the operation of on-premises data centers, cloud computing, networking and individual end-users (desktops, notebooks, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, software, apps and related peripherals), typically fall into three (3) defining categories:

· Solutions Standards . Standards that specify the types of products that can be used (according to manufacturer, version, platform or other defining characteristics), as well as the process by which these standardized products are acquired.

· Utilization Standards . Standards that specify the applicability of a given technology product (or set of products) to a demonstrated, stated business need, forming the basis of technology planning, procurement, and product selection recommendations.

· Configuration Standards . Standards that specify the way selected devices, software and apps are installed and configured.

Standards encourage use of common platforms or approaches, streamline operational and sustainment activities, enable compliance and security and drive scale to maximize purchasing power. Adhering to technology standards will reduce support logistics and maintenance costs and increase availability by enabling system optimization. Standards may define or limit the tools, proprietary product offerings, or technology protocols which supported state entities may use, develop, or deploy.
