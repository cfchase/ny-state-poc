## **Appendix E - State Agency Divisions of Authority**

$^{ }$One agency, either ITS or DHSES, serves as the lead agency for State responses to a cyber incident based on the type of governmental entity affected.

· For incidents that impact Executive state agencies hosted by ITS, ITS is the lead agency.

· However, there are limited exceptions to these general rules, for example:

· For most other incidents, including those that impact local governments, non-Executive agencies, public authorities, and critical infrastructure sites, DHSES is the lead agency.

o If a local government reports an incident to DHSES but declines State assistance, DHSES will refer the case to ITS for appropriate remediation of potential threats to State agencies.

o If an incident affects multiple entities, a lead agency may be designated.

## **Other organizations that may be involved are:**

· NYSIC, which will support the response through the production and dissemination of threat intelligence to inform the State's response and help potential victims protect themselves.

· DHSES OEM, which may be designated the lead agency should the cyber incident involve physical or government service impacts designated as major incidents. Consequence management for the non-cyber impacts of the response could require an expanded State response, which may involve Multi-Agency Coordination Calls or activation of the State Emergency Operations Center (EOC), coordinated by DHSES OEM.

· NYS Division of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA), which provides assistance to the State response as deemed necessary and directed.

· Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) will assist with coordinating information exchange between their constituents and the State. This does not preclude involvement from any other State agency in responding to a cyber incident but, rather, serves to establish clear lines of authority and direction during time-sensitive incidents.

o In particular, ITS will prioritize their efforts to ensure its tenants (i.e., Client Agencies) are not impacted.

## **Responsibility of Agencies:**

· The lead agency is responsible for coordinating all aspects of the State response, notifying and updating the Executive Chamber and coordinating with the Executive Chamber on communications and other issues as necessary

· The lead agency is responsible for notifying the Division of Budget (DOB) and Office of General Services (OGS) when fiscal impacts are expected, or additional resources are needed to respond to or remediate the incident.

· The lead agency will coordinate with the affected governmental entity or entities and with external response entities such as federal agencies and federally designated Information Sharing and Analysis Centers.

· All State agencies, including SSAs, that may manage their own connections with the victim, will work with and through the lead agency to carry out their responsibilities.

Please note that the lead agency does not necessarily perform all response functions. More

often than not, this will include a multi-agency response, and the lead agency can call on other agencies to perform certain activities as needed.
