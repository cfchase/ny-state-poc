The SE must define the organizational risk tolerance to support an effective risk management program. It is important to note that defining SE risk tolerance is an executive-level function and cannot be solely defined by Information Technology (IT) professionals unless explicitly delegated by the SE. Defining risk tolerance includes determining who is allowed to accept risk at defined risk levels (low, moderate, high). The SE is still responsible for risk management decisions even if risk tolerance determinations are transferred to an external entity.

SEs must establish organizational mechanisms for implementing the defined risk tolerance. For example, an SE may incorporate risk tolerance criteria into risk assessment and response activities or develop separate procedures to review identified risks and approve recommended risk responses in alignment with SE risk tolerance.

Where an identified risk affectsmultiple SEs, the strictest risk tolerance must apply. For example, where a risk identified in a system that processes both high confidentiality data for one SE but low confidentiality data for another, the strictest risk tolerance must be implemented, where possible. For risks that affect statewide infrastructure, the IT custodian must be included as a stakeholder.

## **4.2.2 Governance**

Governance ensures that strategic and operational decisions align with the SE's defined risk tolerance to ensure that risk-based activities are monitored and evolve with the changing threat landscape. The SE must implement mechanisms to monitor risk management processes (e.g., establish and track approved risk assessment methodologies, risk responses, or create risk management procedures) and regularly review performance, at least annually. This review serves two purposes:

**1** Ensuring compliance with the information security risk management strategy (this includes relevant regulatory or business requirements) of the SE; and

**2** Identifying potential changes required to the SE risk management strategy.

SE information security risk management activities should align with the processes used for other types of risk (e.g., financial, legal) to incorporate information security risk into existing strategic activities. SE information security risk management is only one type of risk that an SE must manage and should be prioritized as part of overarching strategic activities.
