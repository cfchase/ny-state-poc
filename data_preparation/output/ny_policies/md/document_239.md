Using the State vehicle to take friends to the ball game violates this Policy for two reasons. First, travel to and from the ball game is clearly personal and not connected in any way to official State business. Second; carrying persons who are not State employees and who are not engaged in official State business violates this Policy and creates a potential liability for the State.

An employee takes a vehicle home overnight prior to an all-day meeting in another part of the State and leaves h√¨s vehicle at his official work location: He has tickets to a ball game the evening before his trip, and because the only vehicle he has available is the State vehicle, he drives himself and three friends to the ball game.

## **F Use of Drivers**

An employee may have another State employee drive the employee in a State vehicle for official business, but driving another State employee cannot be the sole or primary duty of any State employee.

## **G. Vehicle Use Logs**

1 Agencies and authorities shall maintain a vehicle use log for all State vehicles. Such shall require any person using a State vehicle to record at least the following information:   employee name; dates and times of use driver and occupants of the vehicle, starting location and destination; purpose of the trip, starting and ending odometer readings, fuel and oil purchases, and employee signature. Except for personal use that is incidental to official State business (see the examples in Section E of this Policy) , all personal use must be clearly identified as such in the vehicle use log. logs

**2** Each of a trip should be separately recorded in the vehicle use log. For example, if an employee who has an all-day meeting in a different part of the State takes a State vehicle home the evening prior to the meeting; drives to the meeting the next morning; drives home that evening; and returns the vehicle the following morning; she should separately record:  (1) the trip from the official work location to home; (2) the trip from home to the meeting; (3) the trip from the meeting back to home; and (4) the trip from home to the official work location to return the vehicle. leg
