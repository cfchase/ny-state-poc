Individuals who travel to international locations with the intent of accessing non-public NYS systems and data should consult with their SE's legal counsel to determine relevant laws and restrictions specific to destination locations. SEs have the responsibility to educate their staff on the requirements for secure handling of information, as well as developing and maintaining specific SE processes and procedures to mitigate any associated risks. SEs may wish to review the U.S. Department of State's Travel Advisories page for additional information: https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/.

Information security considerations include, but are not limited to:

· International locations may monitor all network communications and data traffic;

· Potential for review and possible duplication of hard drives at entry/exit or other checkpoints;

· Absence of security controls on publicly available networks;

· Loss or theft of devices;

· Device tampering;

· Installation or download of software not authorized by the SE;

· Potential for remote monitoring via integrated camera and/or microphone; and

· Additional technical considerations will vary depending on the country where the individual is located.

Legal and privacy considerations include, but are not limited to:

· Certain Federal regulations prohibit regulated data from being stored in, or accessed from, international locations;

· The use of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and encryption technologies may not be legal in international locations;

· Some online behaviors that are legal in the U.S. are not legal in international locations (e.g., restrictions on social media activity, prohibited websites, etc.);

· International locations may have differing import and export controls;

· Privacy laws vary considerably and may be different than in the U.S.; and

· Foreign customs agents may require access to an electronic device or data, and may seize the device if the individual does not comply.
