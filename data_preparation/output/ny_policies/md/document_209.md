This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this standard and an SE's standard, the more restrictive standard will take precedence.

This standard applies to all information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) systems owned and/or operated by, or operated on behalf of an SE.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

Baseline security configuration profiles are used to implement hardened configurations on information systems and improve overall security. Baseline security configuration profiles must be implemented with least functionality (i.e., configuration of the information system to provide only essential capabilities) and reviewed at least annually. Profiles can include operating systems (OS), technology services, and software packages. These profiles must be based on one or more of the industry consensus guidelines listed below, in addition to the latest manufacturer or vendor security guidance:

· Industry Consensus Guidelines

· Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Standard Technical Implementation Guidelines (STIG)

Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks

· National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST) National Checklist Program

Any changes to configurations or profiles must be formally identified, proposed, reviewed, documented, and retained for audit purposes. These changes must also be analyzed for security impact, tested, and approved prior to implementation in accordance with the SE's change management procedures. Security impact analyses must be conducted by the SE ISO/designated security representative or a delegate with the necessary skills and technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications.
