## **Cyber Risk Coordinator Description**

As outlined in Section 4.1., SEs must designate an individual or group to be responsible for cyber-related risk management. The Cyber Risk Coordinator (CRC) is the SE-assigned individual who ensures that cyber-related risk is managed within an SE. Organizations can implement this role either as a function of a current role (e.g., counsel, internal controls, etc.), or by creating a new role. The CRC must understand the SE's strategic goals and objectives. This individual should be either authorized to or made able to facilitate riskbased decision making, working with executive leadership. Where cyber security is a shared responsibility between SEs and ITS, the SE is responsible for managing security requirements and risk, by performing and/or participating in the following functions:

· Identification of critical assets

· Account management and control of agency resources

Data classification

Incident response and management

Developing requirements for systems that support business functions

· Employee awareness and training

· Preparation and review of agency policies and procedures

· Routine assessments where the SE must play a lead role (e.g., annual Nationwide Cyber Security Review)

Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity planning
