## **4.10 Internal Controls**

It is the responsibility of the Division Executive, or the Executive's designee, to which a State Vehicle is assigned to develop and maintain necessary internal controls. The controls will include but not be limited to developing appropriate preventative and detective controls over: (i) monthly financial reports to address improper charges; (ii) mileage and destination records to increase accuracy; and (iii) compliance with this Standard and related sections of other relevant policies, standards, and guidelines (e.g., record retention).

ITS may pursue recovery of unauthorized charges and administrative action against the driver and/or Supervisor and may also refer the failure to comply with this Policy for criminal investigation.

## **4.11 Vehicle Redeployment, Replacement and Surplus**

## **1. Redeployment**

**a** It is ITS policy that State Vehicles are considered underutilized if they are driven under 10,000 miles per year.

**b** Given the specific Business Unit uses, some State Vehicles may be retained with a low annual mileage under 10,000. Examples include vans that are used for such things as transporting equipment.
