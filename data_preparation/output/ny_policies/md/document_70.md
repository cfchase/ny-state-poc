This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any ITS resource for which ITS the SE has administrative responsibility,

including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the ITS SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements in this one.

This standard applies to all systems, which includes websites and web services, for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including those managed and hosted by third parties on behalf of the State.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

The need for encryption of information is based on its classification, risk assessment results, and use case.

Attention must be given to the regulations and national restrictions (e.g., export controls) that may apply to the use of cryptographic techniques in different parts of the world. The US Government restricts the export, disclosure, or release of encryption technologies to foreign countries or foreign nationals, including "deemed exports" to foreign nationals within the United States (excluding those foreign nationals with permanent resident visas (e.g., Green Cards), US citizenship, or 'protected person' status). If you have any questions, please contact Counsel and Legal Services.

Encryption products for confidentiality of data at rest and data in transit must incorporate Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) approved algorithms for data encryption. Approved encryption algorithms are contained in Appendix A.

Hashing algorithms transform a digital message into a short representation for use in digital signatures and other applications to validate the integrity of the message. Although a hash function, such as SHA 1, provides a certain amount of security strength, it does not meet all security requirements for keyed-hash functions such as HMAC SHA 1. Refer to FIPS 180-4 Secure Hash Standard (SHS) for more information on different types of application hashing algorithms as well as Appendix A.
