third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

This standard covers all media containing SE information regardless of the classification of the information stored, format or location, including that which is held by third parties on behalf of the SE. Electronic media may be contained in or be a part of personal or laptop computers, printers, scanners, fax machines, mobile devices, copiers, or other devices which may allow temporary or permanent storage of information.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

As per the NYSP03-002 Information Security Policy, information must be properly managed from its creation, through authorized use, to proper disposal. The SE must classify the information to be stored on the media according to the NYS-S14-002 Information Classification Standard, whether the data is encrypted or not. Without classification, the risk of an SE losing control of media containing sensitive information is greatly increased.

The SE must ensure that users and custodians of information are aware of its sensitivity and the basic requirements for media sanitization and secure disposal.

The SE must ensure that all workforce members, including property management and custodial staff, are made aware of the media sanitization and secure disposal process in order to establish proper accountability for all information.

The SE must ensure that confidential material is destroyed only by authorized and trained personnel, whether in-house or contracted, using methods outlined in this standard.

The SE may use service providers for destruction purposes provided that the information remains secure until the destruction is completed. The service providers must follow this standard. The SE must ensure that maintenance or contractual agreements are in place and are sufficient in protecting the confidentiality of the system media and information commensurate with the information classification standards.

## **Methods of Media Sanitization**

The following table depicts the three types of sanitization methods and the impact of each method.
