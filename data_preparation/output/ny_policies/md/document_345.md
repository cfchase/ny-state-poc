For use cases where a device will be principally used by a single individual, ITS will assign one (1) device, and associated peripherals, to each individual.

The user and Client Agency, as custodians of the device, are expected to take reasonable measures to ensure that the device and associated peripherals are appropriately cared for.

ITS will re-assign devices upon request. The custodian must at least annually recertify assignment and location of issued devices though a process established by ITS, and report loss or damage to ITS in a timely manner.

For use cases where a device will be used by one or more users, in a single physical location or within a larger asset (e.g., a vehicle, boat, trailer, etc.), ITS will assign devices as appropriate.

The Client Agency, as custodian of the device, is expected to take reasonable care to ensure that the device and associated peripherals are appropriately cared for. ITS will re-assign devices upon request. The custodian must at least annually re-certify assignment and location of issued devices, and report loss or damage to ITS in a timely manner.

## **4.2.2 Peripherals**

Standard peripherals associated with computing devices will be issued based on standard service offerings, as defined in the ITSM Service Catalog.
