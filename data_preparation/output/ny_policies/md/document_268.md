**2** Risk Avoidance - These are specific actions taken to eliminate the activities or technologies that are the basis for the risk. This is appropriate when the identified risk exceeds the SE's risk tolerance, even after controls have been applied (i.e., residual risk). For example, choosing not to connect to an unsecured network.

**4** Risk Transfer/Sharing - These are specific actions taken to shift responsibility for the risk, in whole or in part, to a third party. This may be appropriate when it is more cost-effective to transfer the risk, or when a third party is better suited to manage the risk. For example, the purchase of an insurance policy, by which a specified risk of loss is passed from the policyholder to the insurer.

Regardless of the chosen risk response, all NYS Information Security Policies and Standards must be adhered to. If the chosen response does not meet any one or more NYS Information Security Polices or Standards, the SE must submit an exception request to the Chief Information Security Office (CISO) as outlined in the NYS-P13-001 NYS Information Security Exception Policy.

## **4.5 Risk Monitoring**

The SE must monitor and review, at least annually, the effectiveness of its risk response measures and maintain situational awareness regarding security and privacy by performing ongoing risk monitoring activities.

## **4.5.1 Risk monitoring activities include, but are not limited to:**

**1** Implementation of a process to alert the SE of significant changes in the factors used to assess its risk (e.g., assets, threats, controls, regulations, policies, risk tolerance). These changes/factors indicate that a new or updated assessment is needed.

**3** Performing ongoing risk assessments when changes to the system, organization, compliance requirements, etc. are identified. A new risk assessment may be required following a security incident.
