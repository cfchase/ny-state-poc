**8** Migration processes must be documented and implemented to govern the transfer of software from the development environment up through the production environment.

## **b. Network Systems:**

**1** Connections between systems must be authorized by the executive management of all relevant SEs and protected by the implementation of appropriate controls.

**2** All connections and their configurations must be documented and the documentation must be reviewed by the information owner and the ISO/designated security representative annually, at a minimum, to ensure:

**i** the business case for the connection is still valid and the connection is still required; and

**ii** the security controls in place (e.g., filters, rules, access control lists, etc.) are appropriate and functioning correctly.

**3** A network architecture must be maintained that includes, at a minimum, tiered network segmentation between:

**i** Internet accessible systems and internal systems;

**ii** systems with high security categorizations (e.g., mission critical, systems containing PPSI) and other systems; and

**iii** user and server segments.

**4** Network management must be performed from a secure, dedicated network.

**5** Authentication is required for all users connecting to State internal systems.

**6** Network authentication is required for all devices connecting to State internal networks.

**7** Only SE authorized individuals or business units may capture or monitor network traffic.

**8** A risk assessment must be performed in consultation with the SE ISO/designated security representative before the initiation of, or significant change to, any network technology or project, including but not limited to wireless technology.
