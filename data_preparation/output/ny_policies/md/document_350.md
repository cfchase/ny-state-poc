systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of ITS or the SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

This standard is applicable to all systems owned or operated by, or on behalf of, NYS.

This standard relates specifically to vulnerabilities that can be addressed by a software or firmware update (patch) and applies to all software used on NYS systems. The NYSS15-002 Vulnerability Scanning Standard should be followed for requirements on addressing non-patched vulnerabilities.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

**1** State entities (SE) are responsible to ensure an individual or group is overseeing patch management for any given system. That individual or group may be within IT operations.

**2** If patch management is outsourced, service level agreements must be in place that address the requirements of this standard and outline responsibilities for patching. If patching is the responsibility of the third party, SEs must verify that the patches have been applied.

**3** A process must be in place to manage patches. This process must include the following:

路 Monitoring security sources (Exhibit 1) for vulnerabilities, patch and non-patch remediation, and emerging threats.

路 Overseeing patch distribution, including verifying that a change control procedure is being followed.

路 Testing for stability and deploying patches.

路 Using an automated centralized patch management distribution tool, whenever technically feasible, which

o Maintains a database of patches.

Deploys patches to endpoints.

o Verifies installation of patches.

**4** Appropriate separation of duties must exist so that the individual(s) verifying patch distribution is not the same individual(s) who is distributing the patches.

**5** As per the NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy, all SEs must maintain an inventory of hardware and software assets. Patch management must incorporate all the SE's installed IT assets.
