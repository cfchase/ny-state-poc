## **International voice/data service**

## **Repair/Replacement**

At ITS' discretion, inoperable standard mobile devices will be repaired or replaced with new or repurposed like devices. Lost or stolen standard mobile devices will be replaced with new or repurposed like devices.

## **Deprovisioning Mobile Devices**

ITS is responsible for maintaining an accurate inventory of available and allocated mobile devices. This inventory enables ITS to provide the necessary mobile devices to Client Agencies - ensuring that agency users have the tools they need to properly serve the citizens and businesses of New York State.

It is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly offboard its user upon separation from the agency or return devices no longer needed to include coordination with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before proceeding with deprovisioning requests to ITS. Whether the user leaves state service or simply transfers to a new agency, the Client Agency must promptly complete and submit an Employee Offboarding request through the ITSM Service Catalog which provides ITS WPS the necessary information to reclaim and re-allocate the mobile device. For devices no longer needed, the Client Agency must promptly complete and submit a Return a Mobile

Device request through the ITSM Service Catalog and ship the device to the address provided in ITSM.

Before a Client Agency submits a request to offboard a user, it should first consult with the Chief Legal Officer of the Client Agency to ensure all legal preservation obligations are met. Devices no longer in use by a Client Agency should be returned to ITS, unless directed otherwise by the Chief Legal Officer of the Client Agency due to legal preservation obligations.
