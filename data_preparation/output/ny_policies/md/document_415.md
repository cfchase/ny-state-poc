# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

Mobile devices often need additional protection because by their nature, these devices generally have a higher exposure to threats when compared to SE devices that are only used within a State Entity's (SE) facilities and on the SE's networks.

This standard outlines the additional protections required for the use of mobile devices by SEs.
