In connection with complying with this posting requirement, SEs should also evaluate the manner in which users access the various portions of the State Agency Website. In the event that users can directly access portions of the State Agency Website, such as surveys, registrations, order forms, or sign-in screens, which may collect information relating to the user without first visiting the State Agency's Website, the SE should consider placing links to their Internet privacy policy on those portions of the State Agency Website with such links being "conspicuous and direct" as described in the preceding paragraph.

## **4.3 Initial Steps**

An SE should first determine what practices and procedures are currently in use with regard to: (1) the collection of information, including personal information, with respect to a user at its website; (2) the retention, disclosure of any information collected; and (3) the consequence of any breach of these practices and procedures (e.g., breach notification policy). Any of these current practices and procedures that involve personal information must comply with the requirements of the PPPL (Public Officers Law, Article 6-A). The PPPL specifies when an SE is authorized to maintain and disclose personal information concerning individuals.

The SE should evaluate whether all of its current practices and procedures regarding the collection of information through its website serve agency purposes. If unnecessary

information is being collected through the website, the SE should revise its practices and procedures to eliminate the collection of that information.

Because State Agency Website includes websites operated on behalf of SEs by other public or private entities, it would be appropriate for the SE to evaluate, in the manner described in the preceding paragraphs of this section, the practices and procedures of any entities with which it contracts for the operation of all, or a portion, of the SE's website. Existing contracts with other entities to operate websites on behalf of the SE may include language requiring compliance with all applicable laws, and the SE should inform those entities of the requirements of the ISPA. New contracts for the operation of a website on behalf of an SE should specifically require compliance with the provisions of the ISPA.
