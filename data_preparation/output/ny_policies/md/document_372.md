**2** Employees may not use their official title, position, or authority in fundraising effort. Employees may also not use State equipment or services in soliciting contributions.

**4** Supervisors may not solicit contributions from subordinates in their business unit but may solicit from coworkers or managers.

**6** Under no circumstances must employees be instructed to donate or participate.

**5** Employees may not solicit during work time. This does not include breaks or before or after work. Leaving pledge forms, "honor system" items, or other materials in a break or common area is not considered solicitation during work time and is allowed.

## **B. Special Considerations for Supervisors**

Managers and supervisors should be aware that by virtue of their position, the employees in their business units may feel compelled or obligated to participate in charitable giving. Accordingly, managers and supervisors should use caution to avoid any activity that could be perceived as potentially coercive. Employees in positions of authority should seek guidance from the Ethics Officer before engaging in any charitable solicitation or other activities that may be perceived as coercive, but are generally prohibited from soliciting charitable donations from subordinates, but may solicit from coworkers or managers.

The following types of activities are generally not considered solicitations and are permissible. However, managers should still be cautious when asking subordinates to participate in any non-work-related activities.

· Having flyers or posters in your office or cubicle for non-political events, such as plays, festivals, or concerts.

· Collecting money for gifts for employees, such as birthdays, major life events, or leaving State service.

· Reminding employees of State sponsored charitable events, such as food drives.
