Drafting or revising an Internet privacy policy should involve ITS, including those professionals responsible for the security of the SE's information technology assets, those program staff responsible for the content of the website, the respective SE's counsel's office, the officers or employees responsible for the SE's compliance with the Freedom of Information Law ("FOIL") and the PPPL, and the SE's officers and employees charged with overseeing the retention and disposition of records. The involvement of these groups will increase the likelihood that the policy will be responsive to all the statutory requirements.

To draft or revise the Internet privacy policy, it may be helpful to begin by answering the eight questions listed below. Answers to one or more of these questions may contain information that adequately addresses other required elements of the policy. Accordingly, as noted above, ITS believes that disclosure of the information required by section 203(1) of the STL need not rigidly follow the order in which the elements are presented in that section. When the technology behind a website changes, or new functionality is added to the website, the Internet privacy policy should be reviewed and revised as necessary. For example, when an SE creates a mobile version of its website, the Internet privacy policy should be reviewed for any changes needing to be specified as applicable to the mobile version.
