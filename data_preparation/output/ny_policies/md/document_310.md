**a** The SE workforce must receive general information security awareness training, to include recognizing and reporting insider threats, within 30 days of hire. Additional training on SE specific information security procedures, if required, must be completed before access is provided to specific SE sensitive information not covered in the general information security training. All information security training must be reinforced at least annually and must be tracked by the SE.

**b** A SE must require its workforce to abide by the ITS Policy, NYS-P14-001, Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources, and an auditable process must be in place for users to acknowledge that they agree to abide by the policy's requirements.

**c** All job positions must be evaluated by the SE to determine whether they require access to sensitive information and/or sensitive information technology assets.

**d** For those job positions requiring access to sensitive information and sensitive information technology assets, SEs must conduct workforce suitability determinations, unless prohibited from doing so by law, regulation, or contract. Depending on the risk level, suitability determinations may include, as appropriate and permissible, evaluation of criminal history record information or other reports

from federal, state, and private sources that maintain public and non-public records. The suitability determination must provide reasonable grounds for the SE to conclude that an individual will likely be able to perform the required duties and responsibilities of the subject position without undue risk to the State.

**e** A process must be established within the SE to repeat or review suitability determinations periodically and upon change of job duties or position.

**f** SEs are responsible for ensuring all State-issued property is returned prior to an employee's separation and accounts are disabled and access is removed immediately upon separation.
