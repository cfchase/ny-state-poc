Following the PTP approval for a 'Contracts - RFP / RFI / Pre-contract' request, the SE may issue the subject solicitation using the appropriate procurement vehicle. In cases of competitive RFPs, prior to issuance of a tentative award to a vendor, the SE must obtain ITS approval. Further, the SE cannot announce an award to any other stakeholders prior to receipt of approval from ITS.

Following completion of the RFP solicitation process, the SE must submit a new PTP for a 'Contracts - New' request containing solicitation supporting documentation, the final chosen vendor, contract cost, and total cost of ownership to sustain the project.

All technology resulting from solicitations are subject to the ITS technology integration and security review process.

## **4.4 Lead Agency Status for Joint or Enterprise Procurements**

To advance procuring technology on behalf of the State, ITS review of a given acquisition may require the assignment of a "lead agency" for a particular technology initiative or a joint procurement opportunity. A lead agency is designated to ensure there is a committed "champion" for the initiative who drives the effort through completion. Once a lead agency has been designated, other SEs might be required to defer pursuing the same technology until a pilot or prototype on behalf of the State enterprise is complete.

In most cases, SEs will be requested to coordinate their procurement efforts with the lead agency. This can be accomplished by either incorporating all requirements into a single procurement based on what the lead agency learned from other SEs; procuring from an existing contract; or identifying a joint application development or system design between multiple SE efforts.

A lead agency status may be designated by the SE originating the PTP request. The PTP request must have the potential for "high enterprise" or "high multi-agency" strategic and operational impact. The likelihood additional SEs may submit a similar request for a similar IT need must be verified. SEs are expected to show due diligence in contacting and ascertaining similar needs across the State.
