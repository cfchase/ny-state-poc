# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

As government services become widely available online, making those online services accessible for all users is critical. This policy recognizes the importance of universal accessibility and establishes minimum accessibility requirements to ensure that Information and Communication Technology ("ICT"), including applications, websites, and other digital interfaces, developed, procured, maintained, or used by State Entities are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

This policy serves as ITS guidance required by State Technology Law (STL) Sections 103(20) and 103(21) regarding NYS Executive Law Section 170-f and STL Section 103D, respectively. These laws require state agencies and each contractor, subcontractor, vendor, consultant, or other person providing services pursuant to a state contract conform any website provided to the most current version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ("WCAG") adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C") for accessibility, or any successor guidelines. The most current version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines can be found here: https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/. Additionally, this policy also serves as guidance for compliance with the U.S. Department of Justice's rule on nondiscrimination on the basis of disability for the accessibility of web information and services (28 CFR Part 35, hereinafter "DOJ Rule").
