If an employee of the SE or an employee of the SE's contractor or agent becomes aware of suspected or actual loss of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or a security incident which includes SSA-provided information, he or she must immediately contact the SE official who is named in the SSA agreement as being responsible for Systems Security. That SE official or delegate must then notify the SSA Regional Office Contact or the SSA Systems Security Contact identified in the SSA agreement. If, for any reason, the responsible SE official or delegate is unable to notify the SSA Regional Office or the SSA Systems Security Contact within 1 hour, the responsible SE official or delegate must report the incident by contacting SSA's National Network Service Center (NNSC) at 1-877-697-4889 (select "Security and PII Reporting" from the options list). As the final option, in the event SSA contacts and NNSC both cannot be reached, the SE is to contact SSA's Office of Information Security, Security Operations Center at 1-866-718-6425 . The responsible SE official or delegate will use an SSA PII Loss Reporting Worksheet, to quickly gather and organize information about the incident. The responsible SE official or delegate must provide to SSA timely updates as any additional information about the loss of PII becomes available.
