ITS provides secure core information technology services that range from fundamental infrastructure services, such as compute, data storage, databases, backup, and networking services, to email, collaboration solutions, artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, application development, managed file transfer, identity management, telephony, and call center services

ITS has implemented IT portfolio management to govern the systematic management of IT investments, projects, and activities of the Information Technology departments. This process ensures alignment between agency business strategy and the technology

strategy for the State by ensuring technology solutions are developed in partnership with agencies and comply with all ITS standards.

ITS also evaluates current and emerging technologies to enable NYS government to meet demands, improve the performance of information systems and create efficiencies that improve the quality of the resident interactions with the State.

When identifying solutions, ITS considers the following in order of priority:

1) Use existing systems first and contribute to shared resources model.

2) Where ITS does not provide the technology or does not have a solution or does not have resources to support a technology, ITS will consider the following:

a) Procure the technology with support services and include knowledge transfer

b) Buy off-the-shelf (or open source) and change business processes to align.

c) Build custom applications.

ITS will evaluate the following factors when considering new or emerging technologies:

· Solutions must be part of the NYS technology strategy and meet the business needs and objectives of client agencies.

· Solutions must be efficient, as measured by operational spend.

· Solutions must be scalable, providing the ability to increase or decrease in performance and cost in response to changes in application and system processing demands.

Solutions must be highly available and allow for failover and/or redundancy.

Solutions must meet established technology standards.

· Solutions must meet security, privacy, compliance, and legal requirements.

· Solutions have adequate skilled support either provided by a third party or ITS staff.

· Solutions must be adequately tested and pass a security review.
