**b** For each job title, an explanation in support of the request for individually assigned vehicles. In cases where there is a need to carry specialized tools or equipment to accomplish job duties, it may be appropriate to individually assign a vehicle, but the vehicle should be parked at a State facility when not in use. As a rule, only employees who are first responders, who are on call 24 hours per day or who are responsible for ensuring public safety will be allowed to take State vehicles home or use vehicles for commuting purposes. Facilities shall maintain a record of any such approvals.

**3** ITS shall review individual assignments of vehicles on no less than an annual basis. If at any time the job duties change and the individual vehicle assignment is no longer warranted, such assignment shall be terminated. Any new individual assignments must be approved by the Director of State Operations as set forth above.

## **4.3 Use of State Vehicles**

State Vehicles should be used whenever possible for State business instead of a personal vehicle. A list of vehicles and contacts is available from Facilities at (518) 4022205 or via email at its.sm.admin.support@its.ny.gov.

**1** State Vehicles may be used only for official State business, and their use for any personal business is strictly forbidden except under very limited circumstances where the personal use is incidental to official business (as described below).

The following are examples of appropriate use of a State Vehicle for official business:

**a** An employee uses a vehicle to travel from the employee's official work location to an official State event and back to the work location.

**b** An employee who has a meeting in a different part of the state takes a State Vehicle home the previous evening, drives to the meeting, drives home that evening, and returns the vehicle the following morning. In this example, driving from the work location to home (even if the employee stops at a store on the way home to pick-up a personal item) is considered personal use incidental to official business and is permitted.
