## **Information Classification Process**

The information classification process must include the following:

**1** Identification of information assets;

**2** Classification of information assets by confidentiality, integrity, and availability ("CIA"); and

**3** Determining controls based upon the classification.

## **1. Identification of Information Assets**

Identification of information assets must involve creating an inventory of all information assets in the SE. The following items must be considered when constructing this inventory:

**A** Grouping of information assets

**B** Determining the information owner

**C** Determining the information custodian

**D** Identifying information assets

## **A. Grouping of Information Assets**

To facilitate the classification of information assets and allow for a more efficient application of controls, it may be desirable to appropriately group information assets together. A broad grouping may result in applying controls unnecessarily as the asset must be classified at the highest level necessitated by its individual data elements. For example, if a human resources unit decides to classify all their personnel files as a single information asset and any one of those files contain a name and social security number, the entire grouping would need to be protected with moderate confidentiality controls.

A narrow grouping allows for more precise targeting of controls. However, as there are more information assets to classify, this increases the complexity of the classification and the management of controls. Using the previous example, classifying the multitude of personnel files (e.g., appointment letters, timecards, position classifications, holiday waivers) as individual information assets require a different set of controls for each classification.
