Every user has a duty to properly use state resources in a manner that will mitigate risk to the State, to include mitigating risk of data loss, unauthorized access, acceptance of unfavorable legal terms and conditions, or compromised security of State systems or State information. The following list of unacceptable uses is not intended to be exhaustive; it is provided as a general framework for activities that constitute unacceptable use. Users, however, may be exempted from one or more of these restrictions when acting within their authorized job responsibilities, after approval from SE management, in consultation with SE IT staff (e.g., storage of objectionable material in the context of a disciplinary matter).

Unacceptable use includes, but is not limited to, the following:

· Unauthorized use or disclosure of personal, private, sensitive, and/or confidential information;

· Unauthorized use or disclosure of State information and resources;

· Distributing, transmitting, posting, or storing any electronic communications, material or correspondence that is threatening, obscene, harassing, pornographic, offensive, defamatory, discriminatory, inflammatory, illegal, or intentionally false or inaccurate;

· Attempting to represent the SE in matters unrelated to official authorized job duties or responsibilities;

· Connecting unapproved devices to the State network or any State IT resource;

· Connecting to any wireless network while physically connected to a State wired network;

· Installing, downloading, or running software that has not been approved following appropriate security, legal, and/or IT review in accordance with SE policies;

· Transmitting unencrypted private information, as defined by the Internet Security and Privacy Act, via email;

· Connecting to non-State supported email systems (e.g., Hotmail, Yahoo) without prior management approval (SEs must recognize the inherent risk in using nonState supported email services as email is often used for phishing, distributing malware, or harvesting credentials);
