## **APPENDIX B: INFORMATION CLASSIFICATION SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE**

## **Introduction**

The classification of information will be the basis for many information security decisions in an organization. Before deciding the level of resources (e.g., money, time, and technology) required for protection, it is essential that you know what information needs to be protected and the level of protection that is required. The purpose of this supplement is to provide additional guidance on the information classification process.

## **Identifying Information Assets**

An efficient approach towards identifying information assets is for information owners to maintain an inventory for each information asset in their control. The inventory should minimally include the following:

**1** Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)

**3** Business processes dependent on the information asset

**2** Use of the information asset (e.g., purpose/business function)

**4** Users/groups of users of the information asset

**5** Owner of the information asset

Information assets can be identified using the template provided in Section One of Appendix A or this information can be extracted from an existing information inventory, if available. In place of named individuals, job titles can be used for the custodian, owner, and users to ease maintenance of your information asset inventory. Samples of completed templates are provided below in Figures 1 and 2.
