This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any Information Technology (IT) Resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and an SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

This standard applies to all systems, web applications, source code, and APIs developed, maintained, or operated by, or on behalf of, all SEs.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

All systems, source code, and web applications must be scanned for vulnerabilities per the NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy. In addition, each must be inventoried and have an individual or group assigned responsibility for maintenance and administration.

## **4.1 Types of Scans**

The type of vulnerability scan appropriate for a given IT Resource depends on its type (i.e., hardware, software, source code, API) and location (i.e., internal or external to the SE's network). The table below lists the types of vulnerability scans required by this standard.
