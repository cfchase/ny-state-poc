| The potential impact is low if the loss of confidentiality, integrity ,  or availability could be expected to have a limited adverse effect  on organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals.  A limited adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of  integrity,  or  availability  might:  (i)  cause  a  degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that  the organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the  effectiveness of the functions is noticeably reduced; (ii) result in  minor damage to organizational  assets; (iii) result in minor                                                                              | Low  confidentiality, |
| A serious adverse effect means that, for example, the loss of  confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause a significant  degradation in mission capability to an extent and duration that the  organization is able to perform its primary functions, but the  effectiveness of the functions is significantly reduced; (ii) result in  significant  damage  to  organizational  assets;  (iii)  result  in  significant financial loss; or (iv) result in significant harm to  individuals that does not involve loss of life or serious life- threatening injuries.                                                                                                       | Moderate              |
| or availability could be expected to have a severe or catastrophic effect on  organizational  operations,  organizational  assets, or individuals.  A severe or catastrophic adverse effect means that, for example,  the loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability might: (i) cause  a severe degradation in or loss of mission capability to an extent  and duration that the organization is not able to perform one or  more of its primary functions; (ii) result in major damage to  organizational assets; (iii) result in major financial loss; or (iv)  result in severe or catastrophic harm to individuals involving loss  of life or serious life-threatening injuries. | High  adverse         |

Each SE should review the potential impact levels in the context of its own operational environment.
