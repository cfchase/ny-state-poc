## **Appendix A - Incident Severity Cyber Incident Severity Schema**

The United States Federal Cybersecurity Centers, in coordination with departments and agencies with a cybersecurity or cyber operations mission, adopted a common schema for describing the severity of cyber incidents affecting the homeland, U.S. capabilities, or U.S. interests. The schema establishes a common framework for evaluating and assessing cyber incidents to ensure that all departments and agencies have a common view of the:

· The severity of a given incident;

· The seniority level necessary for coordinating response efforts; and

The urgency required for responding to a given incident;

The level of investment required of response efforts.

The table below depicts several key elements of how NCISS aligns with the Cyber Incident Severity Schema (CISS) so that severity levels in the NCISS map directly to CISS levels. The general definitions have been altered to reflect New York State scope.
