In the case of an information technology system, such as a database, data warehouse, or application server, it is often easier to apply a single set of controls as a result of classifying the system as a single entity. Costs may be reduced by applying the controls to the individual elements, such as specific fields, records, or applications. Therefore, the SE must evaluate the risk and cost benefit of grouping a given set of assets.

## **B. Determining the Information Owner**

Responsibility for the classification and definition of controls for an information asset belongs to an individual in a managerial position who is ultimately responsible for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information. If multiple individuals are found to be "owners" of the same information asset, a single individual owner must be designated by a higher level of management. The information owner is responsible for determining the information's classification and how and by whom the information will be accessed and used. Information owners must understand the uses and risks associated with the information they are responsible for, and any laws, rules, regulations, or policies that govern access and use. They must also exercise due diligence regarding the proper classification of data to prevent improper disclosure and access.

## **C. Determining the Information Custodian**

Information custodians are people, units, or organizations responsible f or implementing the authorized controls for information assets based on the classification level. An information asset may have multiple custodians. Based on the information owner's requirements, the custodian secures the information, applying safeguards appropriate to the information's classification level. Information custodians can be from the SE or third parties (e.g., another SE or non-SE). If the custodian is a third party, a formal, written agreement between the custodian's organization and the SE that owns the information must specify the responsibilities of each party. An information custodian may also be the information owner.

## **D. Identifying Information Assets**

For each information asset in their control, the information owner must identify at a minimum:

· Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)

· Use of the information asset (i.e., purpose/business function)
