## **4.0 Information Statement**

The State provides several core service delivery functions to the LDSS to support access to the welfare management system:

User Identity and Access Services, including privileged access;

· Workplace User Experience;

· Network Services; and

Security and Data Access.

## **4.1 Workplace User Experience**

## **4.1.1 Virtual Desktops**

Virtual Desktops are pooled, Windows desktops, hosted in the ITS managed Excelsior Cloud which provide consistent, secure access to State-managed applications. LDSS employees may access Virtual Desktops from a State-managed, county-managed, or other network with access to the internet using an appropriately configured personal computer, thin client, or mobile device which supports the Virtual Desktop service or a supported web browser.

Virtual Desktops will include access, as appropriate, to State applications directly supporting LDSS functions; required third party applications and licensing; and State networks and services. Virtual Desktops will not include access to networks or applications specific to any single LDSS entity or not specifically required for LDSS access to State applications.

## **4.1.2 Multi-Factor Authentication**

Access to Virtual Desktops, Virtual Private Network (VPN), third party applications, or other systems requires that each LDSS employee use a State-managed user credential and associated multi-factor authentication (MFA) device. MFA is available either as a physical token or smartphone application and is provided by the State.

## **4.1.3 Credentials and File Hosting**

The State will continue to provide credentials necessary to access State applications and associated services to LDSS employees.

Data germane to the normal and customary use of State applications, stored on Statemanaged file servers supplied by the State, will be migrated to centralized storage in the ITS-managed Excelsior Cloud.

The State will not support components including file/print servers and endpoint management servers.
