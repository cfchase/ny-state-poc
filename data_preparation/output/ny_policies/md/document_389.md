**i** Make a list of all the documents which the SE provides to individuals, such as employees or members of the public, which show or contain an individual's SSN. These can include cards, tags, letters or forms where the SSN appears on the face of the document and cards or documents where the SSN is embedded or encoded in or on the item.

**ii** Divide this list into two types of documents, i.e., those which are sent by postal or electronic mail for the individual's personal review only, and those which are intended for public use (e.g., a badge).

## **iii. For documents intended for the individual's personal review only:**

· SEs may only use the full SSN:

o if required by state or federal law, or

o in applications or forms sent by mail that include documents sent as part of an application or enrollment process, or to establish, amend or terminate an account, contract or policy, or to confirm the accuracy of the SSN

--but--

o for either of the above, only if no portion of the SSN is printed on a postcard or other mailer not requiring an envelope, or visible on the envelope or without the envelope having been opened.

· Otherwise, SEs may only use the last four digits of the SSN, refraining from doing even that when possible. --and--

· unless required by state or federal law, not intentionally communicate or otherwise make available to any third party an individual's SSN.

**iv** For documents intended for public use, SEs should not use any printed SSNs either in part or in full.

SEs should not, unless required by law, require individuals to choose their SSN as an account ID for the purposes of identification on printed communications.

## **d. With regard to e-mail:**

**i** SEs may not include full SSNs in any electronic mail (including in any attached documents) that is copied to third parties, unless state or federal law requires it.

**ii** Otherwise, SEs may only use the last four digits of the SSN, refraining from doing even that when possible.

## **e. With regard to Internet communications:**
