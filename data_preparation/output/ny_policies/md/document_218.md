This standard is intended for all ITS employees or other persons expressly authorized by the Chief Information Officer (CIO) who operate a State Vehicle (drivers).

This standard applies to all ITS owned, or leased, vehicles. Any use of another agency's State Vehicle is subject to that agency's fleet policy.

## **4.0 Information Statement**

Within ITS, the Facilities Services Office ("Facilities") is responsible for managing the Agency's Fleet and maintaining a formal written fleet management standard. Facilities will also provide for proper maintenance of records on the Agency's Fleet including its condition, cost and usage, and will review measures of the efficiency of the Agency's Fleet in accordance with this standard.

## **4.1 Eligibility for Use**

**1** Before being allowed to operate a State Vehicle, the driver must first read and sign the Fleet Vehicle New Driver Agreement Form.

**2** Drivers must be a NYS ITS employee or other person expressly authorized by the CIO that is providing service to the State.

**3** Drivers must have a valid NYS driver's license of the class required for the vehicle being operated and are required to immediately inform their supervisor of any license revocation, suspension, or restriction. This requires all potential drivers to supply their driver's license number; if such information is not provided, they will be ineligible to drive a vehicle.

**4** ITS participates in the License Event Notification Service (LENS) program administered by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The LENS program provides Facilities with reports of driver license revocations, suspensions, and restrictions.
