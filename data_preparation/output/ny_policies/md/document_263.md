Figure 1 demonstrates the interaction between the risk management program functions and organizational tiers. Risk framing primarily operates at the organizational tier, while risk assessments can occur at all tiers of the SE. Both risk response and risk monitoring primarily occur at Tiers 2 and 3. However, the SE risk management program may operate differently depending on the SE's mission and other strategic goals.

It is important to note that information security risk management is dynamic; actions at each organizational tier and risk management function will inform other activities. For example, changes to an SE business process may require changes to an associated information system, requiring a risk assessment. Newly identified risks would require new risk responses and would be incorporated into the SE's risk monitoring activities .

## **4.2 Risk Framing**

Risk framing establishes the SE information security risk management strategy that governs subsequent activities (i.e., assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk). Risk framing activities generally occur at Tier 1 as SE executive management will establish the overarching risk management strategy. Additionally, as required in the NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy, SEs must designate an individual or team responsible for the risk management function. This function will support the development and implementation of the SE risk management program. There are two primary components of the risk framing function: risk tolerance and governance.

## **4.2.1 Risk Tolerance**

Risk tolerance is the level of residual information security risk, including the environmental context that may influence a risk-based decision (e.g., regulatory requirements, SE mission, budget, etc.), that is acceptable for the organization. The SE risk tolerance governs risk response activities at all organizational tiers as it outlines what risks can be accepted. For example, an SE's risk tolerance will influence

the decision to use a new service based on the risk that it presents to the organization. Alternatively, the SE's risk tolerance will help to prioritize remediation activities across several existing SE systems.
