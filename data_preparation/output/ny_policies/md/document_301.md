# Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

This policy defines the mandatory minimum information security requirements for all State Entities (SEs) as defined below in Section 3.0 Scope. Any SE may, based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this policy, but must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy.

This policy acts as an umbrella document to all other Office of Information Technology Services' (ITS) security policies and associated standards. This policy defines the responsibility of all SEs to:

· protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and related infrastructure assets;

· manage the risk of security exposure or compromise;

· ensure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment;

· identify and respond to events involving information asset misuse, loss, or unauthorized disclosure;

· monitor systems for anomalies that might indicate compromise; and

· promote and increase the awareness of information security.

Failure to secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets in today's highly networked environment can damage or shut down systems that operate critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions, and vital government functions; compromise data; and result in legal and regulatory non-compliance.
