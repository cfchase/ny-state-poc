# Title: **$^{ }$1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

The purpose of this policy is to ensure New York State (NYS or State) strategically plans, procures, and manages Information Technology (IT) investments by fully leveraging the State's purchasing power and creating value for delivering better government services across the State enterprise through greater economies of scale.

This policy is designed to:

路 Establish and ensure strategic alignment between the goals and strategies outlined in the NYS IT Strategic Plan.

路 Position NYS government agencies, authorities, and any other relevant entities as an "enterprise" to leverage IT procurements and deployments.

路 Enable better and earlier identification and coordination of IT procurement opportunities among agencies to reduce duplication and redundant spending.

路 Ensure the compatibility of technology acquisitions on a statewide basis.

This policy further elaborates on the shared roles of the NYS Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) and the NYS Division of the Budget (DOB) in implementing the information technology governance framework as defined in both the Statewide Policy for Information Technology Investment and Governance H-0300 and Building a High Performance Government L-1220. Other partners critical to the successful execution of this policy are the NYS Office of the State Comptroller (OSC), and the NYS Office of General Services' (OGS) Business Services Center (BSC).
