## **New York State Gender Inclusive Language Policy Guidance**

## **A. Overview**

This guidance is intended for State Entities as defined under Section B below. It provides instructions on how to draft formal documents without using unnecessary gender-specific language.

This guidance also provides specific instructions regarding State Entity implementation of A.1371-A/S.208-A of 2023, which requires agencies to use gender-neutral terminology on their websites.

## **B. Gender Inclusive Language Policy**

Pursuant to A.1371-A/S.208-A of 2023, as amended by Chapter 21 of the Laws of New York of 2024, State Entities are required to avoid the use of gender-specific language - such as "he," "she," "his," and "her" - on all website content created on or after July 24, 2024. This applies to all website content, including forms accessible through the website, that is created by or on behalf of an agency, or is within an agency's control to modify. While this requirement applies only to website content create on or after July 24, 2024, agencies should also, wherever possible, make updates to older content as well.

In addition to website content, State Entities should also avoid the use of genderspecific language and should adhere to these guidelines when drafting laws, proposed legislation, rules, regulations, reports, policies, and other formal documents.

**a** When conducting reviews of and making amendments to existing laws, legislation, rules, regulations, reports, policies, and other formal documents, State Entities should also, where possible, make updates to remove and replace any gender-specific language from the provision(s) being amended.

**b** If amending portions of existing law with gender-neutral terminology, State Entities should also review the entire section of law to ensure that changes are not creating confusion or conflict with other language within the section and should make additional conforming amendments as needed.

**c** For purposes of this policy, "State Entities" shall mean (i) all agencies and departments over which the Governor has

executive authority and as defined in subdivision 3, section 2a of the State Finance Law; and (ii) all public benefit corporations, public authorities, boards, and commissions f or which the Governor appoints the Chair, the Chief Executive, or at least 50% of the entity's board members, commissioners or comparable officers.

## **C. Gender-Specific Nouns**

(i) State Entities should avoid using nouns that are genderspecific, and should , where possible, use substitutes of the same meaning. See Section F for exceptions.

**a** Gender-specific nouns and possible substitutes include but are not limited to:
