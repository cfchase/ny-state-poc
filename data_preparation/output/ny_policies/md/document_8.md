· Data retention settings that follow the requirements of federal and state standards;

Privacy-oriented settings, including data minimization, such as only processing data that is necessary during the development and use the AI system;

· Ensuring the accuracy of data put into the AI system and the AI system's outputs;

· Providing data subjects with control and transparency in relation to data processing.

Disposal of the data once the purpose of using the data has been fulfilled, when possible, in compliance with applicable state and federal laws;

## **4.8 Security**

AI systems must comply with NYS-P03-002: Information Security Policy, NYS-P14-001 Acceptable Use of Information Technology Resources, and all associated standards which can be found at https://its.ny.gov/policies. Any additional controls required by applicable Federal or State law, rule, or regulation (e.g., IRS Publication 1075) must also be incorporated. AI systems must be developed and reviewed in alignment with NYS-S13-001: Secure Systems Development Lifecycle. In addition, SEs should ensure there are adequate security controls including encryption and pseudonymization, where appropriate depending on the risk throughout the data lifecycle.

## **4.9 Technology**

The commercial and open-source landscape of AI is rapidly evolving, and SEs should take steps to periodically ensure that their AI systems continue to meet their business requirements in light of this. Open standards, model lifecycle management, and regular retraining of AI systems are all important elements that SEs should consider.

ITS supported agencies must submit an engineering consultation request through ITS's Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) system and abide by the NYSP08-001: Plan to Procure when considering AI systems.
