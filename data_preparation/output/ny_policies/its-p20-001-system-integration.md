## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This policy sets the architectural requirements to control data and consolidate processing of data through standardized system integrations.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYSP08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.

## 3.0 Scope

This policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, interns, and ITS supported agencies ("Client Agency").

## 4.0 Information Statement

## 4.1 Data Transfer and Sharing Justification

Business data transferred or shared from one system/application to another must be authorized by the information owner. The information owner may be a State Entity (SE) or an individual. A risk analysis must be performed by SE executive management before a data transfer is designed and developed.

## 4.2 Acceptable System Integration Patterns

There are three (3) acceptable system integration patterns for inter-application communication:

1. A service interface built in accordance with the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) Standard.

3. Data migrations executed through the ITS supported Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) services.

2. A file transfer executed through the ITS supported managed file transfer services.

For the purpose of this document, an application is a collection of software and hardware assets that implement a business capability.

These system integration patterns only apply to the transfer of business data (this policy does not apply to system level information).

## 5.0 Compliance

This Policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all ITS policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

If compliance with this policy is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, an exception may be requested through the Chief Technology Office's exception process.
