| Enterprise Mobile  Management                         | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Standard Owner:  Chief Technology Office |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This technical standard establishes the New York State Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) Enterprise Mobile Management (EMM) service for managing mobile device assets and identifies minimum service requirements.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This standard applies to all "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law ("State Entities"), their employees; and all others, including third parties of State Entities (such as

consultants, vendors and contractors), that use or access any ITS Information Technology Resource for which ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the ITS. Where a conflict exists between this standard and a State Entity's standard, the more restrictive policy/standard will take precedence.

This standard applies to the administration of mobile devices.

Mobile devices include smartphones, tablets and other devices running a mobilityoriented operating system, including but not limited to Android, BlackBerry OS, and iOS.

"Feature Phones" primarily intended to handle voice calls and laptops running traditional, general purpose operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux) are out of scope$_{. }$

## 4.0 Information Statement

Mobile devices procured by the State must be able to meet enterprise baseline security and operational requirements for the lifecycle of the device. The EMM service will provide configuration and enforcement of these requirements.

Devices incapable of receiving operating system, integrated application or web browser security updates must either be remediated using other security controls or removed from service.

EMM solutions must enable ITS administrators to meet the enterprise baseline security requirements and additional security controls specific to the agency to which the device is assigned. At a minimum, the EMM solution must have the ability to: encrypt State data using an encryption standard compliant with ITS encryption standards; provide asset management/inventory functions; manage configuration items (including password policy, failed password lockout, and session timeouts); and securely wipe the device of all user data if needed.

## 5.0 Compliance

This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is expected with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is expected.

If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, State Entities shall request an exception through the Enterprise Information Security Office exception process.

## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms
