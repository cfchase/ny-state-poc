|                                                   | Information Classification  Issued By:  NYS Office of  Information Technology Services |

## $^{ }$1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This standard outlines a process and procedure for classifying information in a manner that uniformly protects information entrusted to New York State (NYS) State Entities (SE).

The process of classifying information pursuant to this standard may serve as a basis for the SE to evaluate the retention and disposition schedules for its records. Similarly, the classification process can facilitate the accurate and efficient application of the exemptions from disclosure enumerated in NYS Public Officers Law, Article 6 Freedom of Information Law, providing a framework for a comprehensive assessment of the SE's information assets. The resultant classification rating is used to determine the security controls required to appropriately protect the information.

## $^{ }$2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services ("ITS") with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-

neering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This standard applies to all SEs, defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

The scope of this standard covers information throughout its entire life cycle (i.e., generation, use, storage, and disposition). It covers information in any form including electronic, paper, voice, video, or other physical forms.

## 4.0 Information Statement

As per the NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy, Section 4.5, all information and/or information systems must be classified, reviewed, and revised as needed.

Information classification is based on three principles of security: 1) confidentiality, 2) integrity, and 3) availability. For each principle, information can be classified as low, moderate, or high based on the potential impact on the SE should certain events occur that jeopardizes the information and/or information systems needed by the SE. When classifying the impact, the SE should consider how the information and/or information systems may be used to accomplish its assigned mission, protect its assets, fulfill its legal responsibilities, maintain its day-to-day functions, and protect individuals. Impact levels are defined as limited, serious, and severe or catastrophic. For the purposes of classification, limited impact shall be deemed to include no impact.

## Information Classification Process

The information classification process must include the following:

1. Identification of information assets;

2. Classification of information assets by confidentiality, integrity, and availability ("CIA"); and

3. Determining controls based upon the classification.

## 1. Identification of Information Assets

Identification of information assets must involve creating an inventory of all information assets in the SE. The following items must be considered when constructing this inventory:

A. Grouping of information assets

B. Determining the information owner

C. Determining the information custodian

D. Identifying information assets

## A. Grouping of Information Assets

To facilitate the classification of information assets and allow for a more efficient application of controls, it may be desirable to appropriately group information assets together. A broad grouping may result in applying controls unnecessarily as the asset must be classified at the highest level necessitated by its individual data elements. For example, if a human resources unit decides to classify all their personnel files as a single information asset and any one of those files contain a name and social security number, the entire grouping would need to be protected with moderate confidentiality controls.

A narrow grouping allows for more precise targeting of controls. However, as there are more information assets to classify, this increases the complexity of the classification and the management of controls. Using the previous example, classifying the multitude of personnel files (e.g., appointment letters, timecards, position classifications, holiday waivers) as individual information assets require a different set of controls for each classification.

In the case of an information technology system, such as a database, data warehouse, or application server, it is often easier to apply a single set of controls as a result of classifying the system as a single entity. Costs may be reduced by applying the controls to the individual elements, such as specific fields, records, or applications. Therefore, the SE must evaluate the risk and cost benefit of grouping a given set of assets.

## B. Determining the Information Owner

Responsibility for the classification and definition of controls for an information asset belongs to an individual in a managerial position who is ultimately responsible for the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information. If multiple individuals are found to be "owners" of the same information asset, a single individual owner must be designated by a higher level of management. The information owner is responsible for determining the information's classification and how and by whom the information will be accessed and used. Information owners must understand the uses and risks associated with the information they are responsible for, and any laws, rules, regulations, or policies that govern access and use. They must also exercise due diligence regarding the proper classification of data to prevent improper disclosure and access.

## C. Determining the Information Custodian

Information custodians are people, units, or organizations responsible f or implementing the authorized controls for information assets based on the classification level. An information asset may have multiple custodians. Based on the information owner's requirements, the custodian secures the information, applying safeguards appropriate to the information's classification level. Information custodians can be from the SE or third parties (e.g., another SE or non-SE). If the custodian is a third party, a formal, written agreement between the custodian's organization and the SE that owns the information must specify the responsibilities of each party. An information custodian may also be the information owner.

## D. Identifying Information Assets

For each information asset in their control, the information owner must identify at a minimum:

· Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)

· Use of the information asset (i.e., purpose/business function)

· Business processes dependent on the information asset

· Users/groups of users of the information asset

## 2. Classification of Information Assets

Information owners must answer the questions in the Information Asset Classification Worksheet (Appendix A) to determine the classification of their information assets. Questions are categorized by confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each question must be answered sequentially to the best of the information owners' abilities.

Information owners should consult with subject matter experts who have specific knowledge about the information asset, such as their Counsel's Office and the Records Management Officer. The Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative may also be called upon to advise and assist the information

owner in determining the classification. An SE may add more questions to the Information Asset Classification Worksheet but may not alter or remove the original questions.

Information assets are classified according to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each of these three security principles is individually rated as low, moderate, or high. For example, an information asset may have a confidentiality level of "high", an integrity level of "moderate", and an availability level of "low" (i.e., HML).

## 3. Determination of Controls

After the classification has been determined, the resultant rating is used to determine the security controls required to appropriately protect the information. When determining the appropriate controls, SEs must review and select controls that correspond to the highest information classification rating in any category (e.g., a "high-water" mark). For example, a low-impact system is defined as a system in which all three information classification ratings are low. A moderate-impact system is defined as a system in which at least one rating is moderate and no ratings are high. A high-impact system is defined as a system in which at least one rating is high.

There is no single set of controls that addresses all security concerns in every situation. However, NIST Special Publication 800-53B - Control Baselines for Information Systems and Organizations identifies a generalized list of baseline controls for each security impact level. These controls must be evaluated, selected, and tailored to meet the security and business requirements of the SE. SEs must be aware that additional controls may also be required to meet any compliance requirements such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or IRS Publication 1075, if applicable.

## 5.0 Compliance

This standard shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

If compliance with this standard is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, SEs shall request an exception through the Chief Information Security Office exception process.

## APPENDIX B: INFORMATION CLASSIFICATION SUPPLEMENTAL GUIDANCE

## Introduction

The classification of information will be the basis for many information security decisions in an organization. Before deciding the level of resources (e.g., money, time, and technology) required for protection, it is essential that you know what information needs to be protected and the level of protection that is required. The purpose of this supplement is to provide additional guidance on the information classification process.

## Identifying Information Assets

An efficient approach towards identifying information assets is for information owners to maintain an inventory for each information asset in their control. The inventory should minimally include the following:

1. Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)

3. Business processes dependent on the information asset

2. Use of the information asset (e.g., purpose/business function)

4. Users/groups of users of the information asset

5. Owner of the information asset

Information assets can be identified using the template provided in Section One of Appendix A or this information can be extracted from an existing information inventory, if available. In place of named individuals, job titles can be used for the custodian, owner, and users to ease maintenance of your information asset inventory. Samples of completed templates are provided below in Figures 1 and 2.

## Information Needed for Determining the Classification

Before determining the classification, it may be beneficial for the information owner to familiarize themselves with the following areas:

## Source, Purpose, and Value:

 How often the information asset is used.

 How the information asset is used in supporting business functions.

 How often the information asset is updated.

 The cost of creating and duplicating the information.

 Dependencies between this information asset and others.

## Legal Requirements:

 Retention requirements for the information asset including, but not limited to, records retention and litigation hold.

 Laws, rules, regulations, policies, or agreements that mandate special security requirements for the information (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]).

## Access Requirements:

 Whether the information is shared among other units/State Entities, third-parties, Federal/local governments.

 Who has/should have access to the information (e.g., people, positions, organizational units)?

## Health and Safety Concerns:

 Impact on State Entity employees as well as the public.

## Mission:

 The information owner's role (or unit's role) in completing the mission.

 The overall mission of the State Entity.

## Non-tangible Effects:

 The effect of a breach of confidentiality, integrity, or availability on the intangible assets of the State Entity such as reputation, trust, and morale.

 Impact if information asset is not available (temporarily or permanently).

## Classification of Information Assets

Classification of information assets is facilitated by the use of a series of questions. The answers will help determine the information asset classification.

The Information Asset Classification Worksheet , found in Appendix A, contains the confidentiality, integrity, and availability questions that must be answered when classifying information. Following are example answers to assist in determining the appropriate response.

## Confidentiality Questions

[1] Is the information publicly available?

Example(s): Information that must be lawfully made available to the general public from Federal, State, or local government records or information that does not need to be withheld for security, legal or privacy concerns is generally deemed publicly available. Examples include public transportation schedules, a listing of local city events, or health improvement guidelines. These items would be ranked low in confidentiality.

[2] Does the information include or contain PPSI (Personal, Private, or Sensitive Information)?

Example(s): A W-2 form contains a name, as well as a social security number. This would be considered private information and therefore have a minimum confidentiality ranking of moderate, which may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent impact questions. See the NYS Information Technology Policies, Standards and Best Practice Guidelines Glossary for a definition of PPSI.

[3] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on health and personal safety?

Example(s): There may be information which, if publicly released, may impact the health and personal safety of the State Entity's workforce and NYS citizens such as, the blueprint and drawings of critical infrastructure buildings, critical infrastructure related systems, network configurations, or disaster recovery/business continuity plans. These could be exploited by criminals to sabotage or destroy buildings, emergency services, or critical infrastructure operations resulting in a severe impact to health and personal safety of NYS citizens thereby placing these items in the high confidentiality category.

[4] What is the financial or agency liability impact of unauthorized disclosure of information?

Example(s): The State Entity may be exposed to litigation or regulatory fines due to disclosure of information protected by law or confidentiality agreements. For instance, unauthorized release of vendor bid information containing bidder's proprietary information could jeopardize the bidding process as well as potentially expose the State to litigation.

Similarly, if the investment decisions of the State's retirement system become known prior to their execution, it could alter the market sentiment ahead of the investment causing financial losses.

[5] What impact does unauthorized release of sensitive information have on the SE mission?

Example(s): An SE may be charged with ensuring that illegal goods do not enter State borders. As part of that mission, the SE may be responsible for collecting and maintaining information regarding unmanned border crossings. If there was an unauthorized release of that information, resulting in an increase of illegal traffic across State borders, it could have a severe impact on the SE's ability to fulfill its mission.

An example of limited impact would be the release of employee contact information which may result in additional phone calls/emails/office visits.

If a list of local delivery restaurants and their phone numbers is disclosed, there would be no impact.

[6] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on the SE's intangible assets such as the public trust, agency reputation, and public interests?

Example(s): It is important for the government to maintain the public's trust. For example, the unauthorized exposure of medical records from a State-run facility could lead to a loss of the public trust in the State's ability to protect sensitive information.

An SE which collects and maintains the confidential records of citizens requires a high level of public trust. Unauthorized disclosure of data through the actions of a malicious insider, external hacker, or through a random accident could erode the public's trust in the SE and their ability to protect citizen data.

[7] Is confidentiality mandated by law or regulation? If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized disclosure of information.

Example(s): Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws or regulations. Disclosing this information can lead to civil or criminal liability. There are several key statutes, such as HIPAA, that should be examined based on the information asset being classified.

[8] Is the information intended for limited distribution? If yes, determine the impact of the unauthorized disclosure of that information.

Example(s): Some information generated within a State Entity is for internal use only and is not meant to be disclosed externally. The confidentiality of such information varies considerably based on the information asset. Information, such as system security configurations, which, if released, could jeopardize the security of a State Entity's assets, would require high confidentiality controls.

Administrative information, such as procedures for travel approval, though not publicized outside the State Entity, would be information that the public could legitimately obtain and should be ranked as low in confidentiality.

## Integrity Questions

[1] Does the information include medical records?

Example(s): In the case of a health care institution, it is important that medical records and medical history are accurate. For example, it may be important to know whether someone is allergic to specific medications so that they are not administered. In addition, it would be necessary to know whether a person has a particular illness or medical condition which would require special treatment. Malicious or accidental alteration of a patient's health records can cause serious health consequences for that individual. Medical records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate. This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions.

[2] Is the information relied upon to make critical security decisions?

Example(s): It is important that security records (e.g., computer security logs, building security access logs) are accurate in order to verify legitimate access and identify unauthorized access attempts. Security related records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate. This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions.

[3] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on health and safety?

Example(s): There is a potential for severe impact on the safety of citizens if someone accesses an airline system and modifies the onboard navigation system.

The removal or editing of surveillance tapes may have a serious or severe impact depending on the presence of additional information provided by other forms of surveillance.

Something that could be of low to no impact on health and safety would be the unauthorized modification of an employee's calendars.

[4] What is the financial impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information?

Example(s): There are many financial implications for the destruction or modification of information. It does not strictly mean monetary loss but can also include loss of employee time and effort for recovery. Something that would have severe financial impact might be the loss of all financial records from a State Entity's financial management database.

If a database of vendor contact information was deleted, it would involve effort in re-creating the database. This would probably be of limited impact.

[5] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the SE mission?

Example(s): State Entity operations could be drastically affected if information is changed without authorization. For example, if someone removed all the phone numbers in a Do Not Call registry, it would severely impact the mission of the program to prevent unwanted calls to registered numbers.

The mission of a university is to provide education and certify the qualifications of students through academic degrees. Malicious or accidental changes to student academic records would have a severe impact on the university's mission of issuing academic credentials.

[6] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the public trust?

Example(s): The public relies on government to provide accurate information. Failure to do so would erode public trust. For example, if information on certification for licensed professionals was inaccurately modified without authorization and then posted to a public web site, the public would no longer trust the State Entity posting the information as a reputable source for this information.

[7] Is integrity addressed by law or regulation? If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information.

Example(s): Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records, may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws. Allowing unauthorized changes to information may have legal consequences. There are several key statutes that should be examined based on the information asset being classified. For example, HIPAA requires safeguards to protect against threats to the integrity of electronic protected health information.

[8] Is the information (e.g., financial transactions, performance appraisals) relied upon to make business decisions? If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of that information.

Example(s): It is important for financial information to remain reliable. Unauthorized changes to financial transactions (e.g., direct deposit, electronic funds transfer) could severely impact the financial stability of a State Entity.

Employee appraisal records are used to make important personnel decisions. Someone may attempt to falsify records in hopes of getting a promotion, alternate employment, or to diminish someone else's reputation and/or record. The impact to the State Entity could vary dependent upon the situation.

## Availability Questions

[1] This information needs to be provided or available:

· As time permits

· 24 hrs. per day/7 days a week

Within 1 to 7 days

Example(s): Intrusion detection systems send event notifications so that an incident can be analyzed and escalated based on the level of threat. Since security is critical, and severe damage can be caused to State Entity data and networks, this operation is time critical and requires high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week).

[2] What is the impact to health and safety if information were not available when needed?

Example(s): Medical records contain information (e.g., allergies, blood type, previous medications) which is critical for providing patients with accurate medical care. Lack of availability to this data during emergency medical care can lead to life threatening situations therefore placing these items in the high availability (24 hrs. per day/7 days a week) category.

[3] What is the financial impact if information were not available when needed?

Example(s): For any State Entity where online services generate revenue, a disruption of service can have a financial impact which could be deemed severe.

A personal computer system crash which can be solved by a simple reboot would have limited impact.

[4] What is the impact to the SE mission if information were not available when needed?

Example(s): Public transportation's mission is to get customers quickly and efficiently to various locations. If access to train, bus, and subway schedules was unavailable, this could lead to an inability of public transportation to fulfill its mission. The impact to its mission would be severe.

[5] What is the impact to the public trust if the information were not available when needed?

Example(s): State Entities have spent considerable effort modernizing operations to include online services and encouraging the public to use these services. If these services were seriously degraded or disrupted, this could cause serious embarrassment to the State Entity resulting in a severe impact and an erosion of the public's trust in the SE and the online services. The availability, in this case, would be categorized as high.
