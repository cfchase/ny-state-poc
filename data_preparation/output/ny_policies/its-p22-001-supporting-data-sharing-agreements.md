## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The New York State Office of Information Technology Services ("ITS") plays a key role in the exchange, transfer, receipt, storage, and processing of electronic information and data for its Client Agencies. ITS's Client Agencies are subject to a myriad of statutory and regulatory compliance requirements including IRS Publication 1075, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Privacy Act, and the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy. Often, the compliance requirements established by these statutory and regulatory frameworks are passed down to ITS's Client Agencies through data sharing or computer matching agreements. In other cases, the receipt of federal financial participation is conditioned upon adhering to such requirements. As a result, ITS is asked to provide technical reviews of our systems for alignment with these compliance requirements and/or execute agreements with our Client Agencies. This Policy is to establish a support model for ITS when Client Agencies request ITS support for the review and execution of data sharing or computer matching agreements.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 1 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, charges the State Chief Information Officer (CIO) with overseeing and supervising the management and

operations of ITS . Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This Policy applies to ITS, its employees, contractors, consultants, and ITS supported agencies ("Client Agency").

## 4.0 Information Statement

Requests for ITS support in reviewing and/or executing data sharing or computer matching agreements for or with Client Agencies come in many forms. For purposes of this Policy, requests regarding the described items below must be directed to the ITS Division of Legal Affairs ("DLA") at its.sm.dla@its.ny.gov before any commitments to the Client Agency are made on ITS's behalf.

Many ITS Client Agencies have computer matching, data sharing, or similar types of agreements with various federal, state, local, and private entities whereby these entities exchange electronic information and data with the Client Agencies, or vice versa. Often, these agreements include statutory or regulatory compliance requirements for the information technology systems that receive, process, store, and transfer the data to and from the entity to the Client Agency. ITS, as the agency primarily responsible for the management of those systems, is often asked to execute the agreements; however, with different entities having different language in each of the agreements, it is not always appropriate for ITS to be a party to the agreement. Below are the five (5) most common scenarios regarding these agreements and how ITS will respond to each:

a) For agreements where ITS, or the Client Agency's centralized information technology provider, is a required party, ITS will jointly execute the agreement with the Client Agency and the third party.

c) For agreements, new or old, that include information security addenda, or similar, ITS will sign the addenda, but not the underlying agreement unless specified above and where ITS provides information security services to the Client Agency.

b) For agreements where ITS, or the Client Agency's centralized information technology provider, is not explicitly required to be a party to the agreement, ITS will not be a party to the agreement. However, ITS will provide the Client Agency the information they need in order to execute the agreement with the knowledge that ITS will take all reasonable efforts to adhere to the information technology requirements set forth in the agreement.
