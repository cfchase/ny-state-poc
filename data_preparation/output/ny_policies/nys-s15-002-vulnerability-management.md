| IT Standard:                                     | Updated:  02/29/2024                                                                                 |
| Vulnerability  Management                        | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner: Chief Information Security Office |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

Vulnerability scanning is a process by which vulnerabilities are identified. Vulnerability Management (VM) is a process by which the vulnerabilities identified through scanning are tracked, evaluated, prioritized, and managed until the vulnerabilities are remediated or otherwise appropriately resolved. VM ensures that appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of compromise to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Information Technology (IT) Resources.

New York State (NYS) utilizes manual and automated tools to scan systems, computing and network devices, web applications, application code and application programming interfaces (APIs). The results of these scans help inform management and system administrators of known and potential vulnerabilities.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and

business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any Information Technology (IT) Resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and an SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

This standard applies to all systems, web applications, source code, and APIs developed, maintained, or operated by, or on behalf of, all SEs.

## 4.0 Information Statement

All systems, source code, and web applications must be scanned for vulnerabilities per the NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy. In addition, each must be inventoried and have an individual or group assigned responsibility for maintenance and administration.

## 4.1 Types of Scans

The type of vulnerability scan appropriate for a given IT Resource depends on its type (i.e., hardware, software, source code, API) and location (i.e., internal or external to the SE's network). The table below lists the types of vulnerability scans required by this standard.


| Type                                                                                                                                                                       | Description                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Scans of the perimeter of SE networks or any  externally available hosted infrastructure to  identify potential vulnerabilities in Internet  accessible IT infrastructure. | External Infrastructure Scan          |
| Scans of IT infrastructure on SE protected  networks or any hosted infrastructure to  identify potential vulnerabilities.                                                  | Internal Infrastructure  Scan         |
| Unauthenticated scans of SE externally  facing production web applications identify  security vulnerabilities that can be found  without authenticated credentials.        | Unauthenticated Web Application  Scan |

|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Authenticated Web Application  Scan | Authenticated scans of SE web applications  identify security vulnerabilities for each level  of access available within the web application.                                  |
| Application Source Code Analysis    | Scans of application source code run during  development, or when necessary for change  control, to identify problems in the code that  could cause potential vulnerabilities. |

## 4.2 Scanning

SEs are responsible for confirming that vulnerability scans are conducted and successfully completed. SEs must use a scanning tool approved by the SE's ISO/designated security representative. Approved scanning tools must be able to provide remediation suggestions and be able to associate a severity value to each vulnerability discovered based on the relative impact of the vulnerability to the affected IT Resource.

Scan reports are classified with a minimum of moderate confidentiality and moderate integrity, per the NYS-S14-002 Information Classification Standard, and should be protected as such.

Network and system administrators must provide sufficient access and configuration information to allow the approved vulnerability scanning tool to scan all services provided by the system. No devices connected to the network shall be specifically configured to block approved vulnerability scanning from an authorized scanning tool.

Scans must be performed within the system development life cycle ( see NYS-S13-001 SSDLC Standard) while in pre-production environments, when deployed to the production environment, and periodically thereafter as specified below:

4.2.1 Pre-production scans occur prior to the move of the system, source code, or web application to the production environment:

· All systems must undergo an authenticated internal infrastructure scan, where technically feasible, before being deployed to the production environment. Any infrastructure vulnerability discovered must be remediated, determined to be a false positive, or deemed an insignificant risk by the SE ISO/designated security representative prior to the system being deployed for intended use.

· When source code is available, scan of the source code should be conducted throughout the development process. Applications must undergo source code scanning before the application moves to production and between environments if there has been a change to source code.

· Web applications that require authentication must undergo an authenticated scan before being deployed to the production environment or into an environment that is externally accessible. When authentication is required to access the application, scans must run with authenticated access at each access level (e.g., user, admin) supported by the application, except where limitations in the scanning tool and/or application prevent authenticated scanning, in order to determine if vulnerabilities exist in the different functionality of the application accessible by each access level. Any web application vulnerability discovered must be remediated or determined to be a false positive or insignificant risk by the SE ISO/designated security representative prior to the web application being placed into the production environment.

· Any system, source code, or web application deployed to its production environment with un-remediated vulnerabilities must have a formal remediation plan and the documented approval of the SE executive responsible for risk management, or their designee.

4.2.2 Implementation scans occur the first time a system or web application is moved to its production environment:

· Systems must be scanned immediately upon being placed into the production environment with an authenticated internal infrastructure scan, where technically feasible. If the system is accessible from the Internet or an external network, then the system must be scanned with an external infrastructure scan.

· Web applications must be scanned within the first month of being placed into the production environment. An authenticated web application scan is required if feasible, but at minimum an unauthenticated web application scan is required. Sensitivity and criticality of the application must be considered when determining the schedule for the initial implementation scan.

4.2.3 Recurring Scans: After the initial scan in the production environment, the frequency of scans must occur according to the system or application's risk rating (see Table 2).

· When performing internal infrastructure scans on systems built using a shared image, such as workstations, scans may be run on a sampling of systems, but the sample set must vary from scan to scan.

· Web applications in production are required to undergo recurring scans. At minimum, web applications in production are required to undergo recurring unauthenticated application scans.

· All vulnerabilities found during scans must be addressed as per the remediation section below.

## 4.3 Determine Risk Rating and Frequency of Scans

The risk that vulnerabilities pose to systems and applications is based on the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited and the impact if the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the SE's information assets were compromised. The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited increases in direct relation to the systems or application's accessibility from other systems.

The impact of a vulnerability to a SE's information asset is based on that asset's information classification ( see NYS-S14-002 Information Classification Standard). The SE must consider the impact (i.e., high, moderate, or low) of a compromise to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that asset. The highest impact level identified must be used when determining the overall risk rating, per the table below.


| Table 2: RISK RATING                                 | Table 2: RISK RATING                                       | Table 2: RISK RATING                                                          | Table 2: RISK RATING                                   |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                      | Exposure                                                   | Exposure                                                                      | Exposure                                               |
| Impact  (Confidentiality,  Integrity,  Availability) | Systems with no  network  connectivity to  production data | Systems with network  connectivity to  production data (not  Internet facing) | System that is  publicly  available from  the Internet |
| High                                                 | Moderate                                                   | High                                                                          | High                                                   |
| Moderate                                             | Low                                                        | Moderate                                                                      | High                                                   |
| Low                                                  | Low                                                        | Low                                                                           | High                                                   |

The minimum frequency of scans is dependent on the risk rating. All systems and applications that are publicly available from the Internet are considered High risk regardless of their impact rating because they represent a potential entryway to an SE's internal network. Systems and applications without a risk rating must be scanned as if they had a risk rating of "High" until they are rated.

| Risk Rating                   | Frequency                     |
| Infrastructure scans          | Infrastructure scans          |


| High                  | Monthly                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|

| Low                   | Semi-annually                       |
| Web Application Scans | Web Application Scans               |
| High                  | Monthly or after significant change |
| Moderate              | Quarterly                           |
| Low                   | Semi-Annually                       |

## 4.4 Remediation

Vulnerabilities discovered during scans must be remediated based on the systems or application's risk rating (see Table 2) and vulnerability severity identified by the scanning tool as per the table below.
