A trusted identity credential is one in which a State Entity (SE) has sufficient confidence that the identity credential represents the person named in it and that the person engaged in the electronic transaction is the person to whom the identity credential was issued.\n\nThis policy benefits users of systems and e-Government services by providing a framework that creates and issues NYS electronic identity credentials that can be universally trusted by ensuring alignment with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital identity guidelines. SEs will be able to participate in shared identity solutions and reduce the need to issue and manage their own electronic identity infrastructure for e-Government services; resulting in reduced costs of providing online services that require user authentication.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards.

Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .\n\n## **3.0 Scope**\n\nThis policy applies to all \"State Entities\" (SE), defined as \"State Government\" in Executive Order 117, or \"State Agencies\" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy and an SE's policy, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.\n\n## **4.0 Information Statement**\n\nThis policy requires that SE information owners complete digital identity requirements assessments during system design to determine the appropriate Identity Assurance Level (IAL), Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL), and Federation Assurance Level (FAL) for all Information Technology (IT) systems that will require user authentication and contain or process SE data. The assessments focus on:\n\no Identity Assurance\n\n\uf0a7 whether the individual seeking to access the system is who they claim to be and the potential impact to the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the data and\/or system if that individual is not who they claim to be;\n\no Authentication Assurance\n\n\uf0a7 whether the individual accessing the service today is the same individual who accessed the service using the same authenticator previously; and\n\no Federation Assurance\n\n\uf0a7 The strength and manner in which the results of authentication processes and relevant identity information is conveyed between applications.\n\nNYS-P20-001 Page 2 of 14 Completion of the assessments provides a system specific numerical IAL, AAL, and FAL.\n\nAssessments must be documented and kept with other system documentation and must be used to guide system design and functions which impact identity, authentication, and\/or federation services.\n\nAll digital identity assurance processes will be managed using the NYS-S20-001 Digital Identity Standard.\n\n## **4.1 Identity Proofing**\n\nIdentity proofing is the process used to verify an individual's association with their realworld identity. See Appendix A for a visualization of the process.\n\nThe system's IAL defines the degree of confidence that the individual's claimed identity is their real identity.

The likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited increases in direct relation to the systems or application's accessibility from other systems.\n\nThe impact of a vulnerability to a SE's information asset is based on that asset's information classification ( see NYS-S14-002 Information Classification Standard). The SE must consider the impact (i.e., high, moderate, or low) of a compromise to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that asset. The highest impact level identified must be used when determining the overall risk rating, per the table below.\n\n|-|-|-|-|\n| Table 2: RISK RATING | Table 2: RISK RATING | Table 2: RISK RATING | Table 2: RISK RATING |\n| | Exposure | Exposure | Exposure |\n| Impact  (Confidentiality,  Integrity,  Availability) | Systems with no  network  connectivity to  production data | Systems with network  connectivity to  production data (not  Internet facing) | System that is  publicly  available from  the Internet |\n| High | Moderate | High | High |\n| Moderate | Low | Moderate | High |\n| Low | Low | Low | High |\n\nThe minimum frequency of scans is dependent on the risk rating. All systems and applications that are publicly available from the Internet are considered High risk regardless of their impact rating because they represent a potential entryway to an SE's internal network. Systems and applications without a risk rating must be scanned as if they had a risk rating of \"High\" until they are rated.\n\n|-|-|\n| TABLE 3: FREQUENCY OF SCANS | TABLE 3: FREQUENCY OF SCANS |\n| Risk Rating | Frequency |\n| Infrastructure scans | Infrastructure scans |\n\n|-|-|\n| High | Monthly |\n| Moderate | Quarterly |\n| Low | Semi-annually |\n| Web Application Scans | Web Application Scans |\n| High | Monthly or after significant change |\n| Moderate | Quarterly |\n| Low | Semi-Annually |\n\n## **4.4 Remediation**\n\nVulnerabilities discovered during scans must be remediated based on the systems or application's risk rating (see Table 2) and vulnerability severity identified by the scanning tool as per the table below."}

Close coordination between the Information Owners, account managers and administrators, legal, incident response stakeholders and human resource managers is essential for timely execution of removing or restricting user access. Significant risk may include a disgruntled employee or one who has been identified by the SE as a potential risk. Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use authorized access to IT resources to cause harm or through whom adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse impacts to organizational operations and\n\nassets, individuals, or other organizations. An account identifier is required to identify these accounts and prevent inappropriate re-enabling of the account or access. Re-enabling the account requires explicit approval of the SE.

EES provides legal preservation services to ITS and Client Agencies for both email and non-email electronically stored information (ESI). To assist ITS and Client Agencies in meeting their legal preservation obligations, including those associated with investigations, litigation, administrative matters, and statutory requirements, EES has established legally defensible protocols around data collection, preservation, transfer, and destruction. To ensure ITS and Client Agencies are able to meet their legal obligations on this topic, it is imperative that all ITS business units consult with EES as outlined in this policy.\n\n## **4.1 Mailbox Deprovisioning upon Employee, Contractor, or Consultant Separation**\n\nThis policy is intended to supplement the Inactive Mailbox Management Process, dated May 2016 and as amended April 2020, attached in Section 9 of this document.\n\nAfter a state employee, contractor, or consultant leaves state service or transfers to another state agency, the user's mailbox will automatically begin the deprovisioning process and will be purged within 60 days of the separation date. This process will also automatically remove the user's email address from all associated distribution groups and the statewide Global Address List (GAL).\n\nThe deprovisioning process described above does not apply to email data that has been placed on a legal hold by a Client Agency's legal counsel, or their designee, through use of the electronic preservation mechanisms available through the ITSmanaged email system. If a Client Agency's legal counsel encounters issues with placing a legal hold on a user's mailbox, a request for support must be sent to the ITS EES team at its.sm.ees@its.ny.gov.\n\n## **4.2 Home Drive Destruction upon Employee Separation**"}

If a user sends email from his mailbox within these 30 days, the mailbox is no longer stale, and the account will be removed from the report and will not be scheduled for deletion. This 30-day period gives the agency sufficient time to make sure that, where necessary, the mailbox and its contents are maintained. For example, a user may be out on extended medical or other authorized leave, which explains why they have not accessed their mailbox for 30 days. If a user is on such a leave, the agency should enter a ticket in ITSM indicating a leave start and end date, and ITS will take an action to identify that the account is not considered stale during that identified time period."}

The typical Information Technology (IT) Governance processes utilizing the IT Investment Request Form; Agency Governance Boards, and Portfolio Executive Board for decisionmaking may not be well suited to support all response efforts during a Critical Incident or Governor's initiative related thereto For these   situations, ITS has created an expedited project and initiatives submission and approval process. This policy outlines the expedited project and initiative submission and approval process to serve as a repeatable process during Critical Incidents or Governor's initiatives related thereto.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies; including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 1171, established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer (CIO) with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies; protocols; and standards for State government,   including hardware, software, security; and business re-engineering ."}

This policy assures the assigned domain names appropriately reflect New York State government services and major programs. The use of the \"ny.gov\" domain provides for branding New York State government services available on the Internet and enables customers to readily recognize official New York State government entity websites.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy , NYSP08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines.\n\nITS has secured the domain \"ny.gov\" for New York State government entity use.\n\n## **3.0 Scope**"}

This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy\/standard and a SE's policy, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.\n\n## **4.0 Information Statement**\n\nAll SE websites will use a standard domain naming convention which is determined and enforced by ITS.\n\n## **4.1 Domain Naming Convention**\n\nAll domain names must:\n\n\u00b7 Be easily understood and recognizable by the residents of New York State Clearly communicate the purpose of the site;\n\n\u00b7 Be easy to type and avoid using confusing characters such as zeroes (0) in place of the letter \"O\" or the number one (1) in place of the letter \"L\" (l).\n\n\u00b7 Contain no less than 10 but no more than 36 characters, including the ny.gov portion of the domain name (the \"dots\" are considered characters - hence subdomains of ny.gov are to have at least 3 characters)\n\n\u00b7 Contain letters, numbers and dashes (-), but no other special characters such as underscores (_) and blank spaces;\n\n\u00b7 Avoid the use of acronyms whenever possible, unless the acronym meets one of the following conditions:\n\na) The SE is commonly known by the acronym, or\n\nb) The acronym represents a commonly known major program. Major programs may be multiple or single agency programs but widely known to the general public. This program naming option is not intended for small, targeted audience programs. Web pages for such smaller programs must be part of the SE's main domain name pages (e.g., www.health.ny.gov\/flu);\n\n\u00b7 Refrain from using general terms such as \"licenses,\" \"recreation,\" and \"benefits\" without an identifier because they do not represent a specific agency\/program origin or service. For example, \"DriversLicenses.ny.gov\" may be allowed. Statewide services that would be best represented by a general term would be an infrequent exception to this rule (e.g., desktop.ny.gov, login.ny.gov).\n\n\u00b7 Use short URLs over a separate or sub-domain address, for areas on the same website (e.g., use health.ny.gov\/flu instead of flu.health.ny.gov).\n\n## **4.2 Naming Patterns**\n\n## **4.2.1 Naming Patterns Within ny.gov Domain:**\n\nWithin the ny.gov domain, the allowed naming patterns are:\n\n**\"nys_entity_name\"**ny.gov or\n\n**\"program_name\"**ny.gov or\n\n**\"application_name\"**\"agency_name\".ny.gov\n\n**\"program_name\"**\"agency_name\".ny.gov\n\n**\"nys_entity_name\"**ny.gov\/\"program_name\" or\n\n**\"Microsoft_AD_domain\"**ny.gov\n\n## **4.3 General Domain Requirements**\n\nIn addition to the naming conventions, the following restrictions apply:\n\n## **4.3.1 No Non-Government Advertisements**\n\nA dot-gov domain and the ny.gov sub-domain, may not be used to advertise for private individuals, firms, corporations, or imply in any way the federal or state government endorses or favors any specific commercial product, commodity, or service.\n\n## **4.3.2 No Political or Campaign Information**"}

No dot-gov website may link, directly or indirectly, or refer to websites created or operated by a campaign or any campaign entity or political or campaign committee. Political sites, party names, or party acronyms cannot be used.\n\n## **4.3.3 Two-Year Eligibility Period**\n\nAll dot-gov domains are registered for a 2-year period. During this period, a review of eligibility and administrative information is required. If necessary, the dot-gov Registrar will contact the Administrative Point of Contact (APOC) for domains. APOC information MUST be kept current. The dot-gov Registrar may request an updated authorization letter, updated Domain Name Server (DNS) information, or other information. This information enables the federal government to ensure dot-gov domains provide secure, official websites and promote the best possible service to the general public.\n\n## **4.4 Procedure to Request a Domain Name**\n\nSEs must obtain ITS approval before requesting any new third level domains (i.e., \"agency_name\".ny.gov or \"program_name\".ny.gov) using the form at https:\/\/on.ny.gov\/domain-exception-request. ITS will review and respond to all requests within five (5) business days.\n\nOnce a domain has been determined and approved, the appropriate ITS Customer Relations Manager can submit a Service Request ticket to initiate the work required for set up in the ITSM service catalog: Network Services > DNS Entry.\n\n## **4.5 Use of Approved Domains.**\n\nSEs should use only ny.gov domains. It is highly discouraged to use any other top-level domain unless the head of the SE explicitly determines another domain is necessary for the proper performance of an SE function. The use of any other domain runs the risk of the domain being lost or acquired by another entity. The ny.gov address ensures the public that it is an official state site and can be trusted."}

Recommended sanitization techniques for specific types of media are outlined in NIST 800-88, Rev. 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, Appendix A Minimum Sanitization Recommendations.\n\nDisposal without sanitization should be considered only if information disclosure would have no impact on organizational mission, would not result in damage to organizational assets, and would not result in financial loss or harm to any individuals.\n\nThe classification of the information, along with internal environmental factors, should drive the decisions on how to deal with the media. The key is to first think in terms of information confidentiality, then apply considerations based on media type."}

SEs can always increase the level of sanitization applied if that is reasonable and indicated by an assessment of the existing risk. For example, even though Clear or Purge may be the recommended solution, it may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and verification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other options. SEs may not decrease the level of sanitization required. If the SE has not identified the classification of information on media, the disposition should follow the sanitization method for confidential information.\n\n## **Control of Media**\n\nA factor influencing an SE sanitization decision is who has control and access to the media. This aspect must be considered when media leaves organizational control. Media control may be transferred when media are returned from a leasing agreement or are being donated or resold to be reused outside the organization. The following are examples of media control:\n\n## **Under SE Control:**\n\n\u00b7 Media being turned over for maintenance are still considered under SE control if contractual agreements are in place with the SE and the maintenance provider specifically provides for the confidentiality of the information.\n\n\u00b7 Maintenance being performed on an SE's site, under the SE's supervision, by a maintenance provider is also considered under the control of the SE.\n\n## **Not Under SE Control:**\n\n\u00b7 Media that are being exchanged for warranty, cost rebate, or other purposes and where the specific media will not be returned to the SE are considered to be out of SE control.\n\n\u00b7 Important Note: As data and assets of various types and classifications are established or migrated into the Cloud infrastructures of third-party hosting partners, this Standard will continue to apply. If data classified as High is to be stored with a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), the physical data storage must be destroyed after use, and the SE would need to ensure that the destruction was completed by the CSP and that proof of destruction was provided at that time.$_{ }$\n\n## **Reuse of Media**\n\nSEs should consider the cost versus benefit of reuse. It may be more cost-effective (considering training, tracking, and verification, etc.) to destroy media rather than use one of the other sanitization options.\n\n## **Clear \/ Purge \/ Destroy**\n\nThe table below gives a general explanation of the options for sanitization.

This process may include  overwriting not only the logical storage location of a file(s) (e.g., file allocationtable) but  also should include all user- addressable locations. The security goal of the overwriting  process is to replace Target Data with non-sensitive data. Overwriting cannot be used  for media that are damaged or not rewriteable and may not address all areas of the  device where sensitive data may be retained. The media type and size may also  influence whether overwriting is a suitable sanitization method. For example, flash  memory-based storage devices may contain spare cells and perform wear levelling,  making it infeasible for a user to sanitize all previous data using this approach because  thedevicemay notsupport directly addressingall areas wheresensitivedatahas been  stored using the native read and writeinterface. |\n|        | The Clear operation may vary contextually for media other than dedicated storage  devices, where the device (such as a basic cell phone or a piece of office equipment)  only provides the ability to return the device to factory state (typically by simply deleting  the file pointers) and does not directly support the ability to rewrite or apply media- specific techniques to the non-volatile storage contents.

Perform Lesson Learned Activities**\n\n\u00b7 These activities can be the results of actual IR activities or IR capability testing and they should happen relatively soon after the incident is closed. They should include, at a minimum, a recap of the steps involved in response tothe incident, results of the root cause analysis, along with any potential improvement to the process and procedures. Both incident reports and the results of these lesson-learned discussions must be documented for future use and shared with all IR stakeholders for situational awareness and professional development.\n\n## **4.3 Coordination**\n\nCoordination is foundational to effective IR. It is critical that the SE experiencing the incident coordinate early and often throughout the response process with all relevant IR stakeholders and partners. SEs may need to interact with several types of external organizations while conducting IR activities. Examples of these organizations include other IR teams, DHSES OEM, law enforcement agencies, Internet service providers, constituents, and customers. An SE's IR team should plan its incident coordination with those parties before incidents occur to ensure that all parties know their roles and that effective lines of communication are established.\n\nKey aspects of coordination include:\n\n\u00b7 Plan incident coordination with external parties before incidents occur.\n\n\u00b7 Consult with counsel before initiating any coordination efforts.\n\n\u00b7 Perform incident information sharing throughout the incident response life cycle.\n\n\u00b7 Attempt to automate as much of the information sharing process as possible.\n\n\u00b7 Balance the benefits of information sharing with the drawbacks of sharing sensitive information.\n\n\u00b7 Share as much of the appropriate incident information as possible with other organizations.\n\n\u00b7 Any required mandated notifications should be followed. (e.g., NYS Information Security Breach Notification Act [\"ISBNA\"])\n\n## **4.4 Incident Response (IR) Metrics**\n\nSEs should compile IR metrics for each incident for overall situational awareness when possible and practical. In addition, these metrics can be used for periodic reporting purposes.\n\nThese metrics allow IR stakeholders (1) to measure IR effectiveness (and reveal potential gaps) over time; (2) to identify trends in terms of threat activities; and (3) to provide justification for additional resources (personnel, training, and tools) . Example metrics are below:"}

The schema establishes a common framework for evaluating and assessing cyber incidents to ensure that all departments and agencies have a common view of the:\n\n\u00b7 The severity of a given incident;\n\n\u00b7 The seniority level necessary for coordinating response efforts; and\n\nThe urgency required for responding to a given incident;\n\nThe level of investment required of response efforts.\n\nThe table below depicts several key elements of how NCISS aligns with the Cyber Incident Severity Schema (CISS) so that severity levels in the NCISS map directly to CISS levels.

This document also provides the requirements for management of those authentication devices.\n\n## **$^{ }$2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology Policies, Standards, and Guidelines\n\n## **3.0 Scope**\n\nThis policy applies to all \"State Entities\" (SE), defined as \"State Government\" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or \"State Agencies\" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy\/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy\/standard and a SE's policy\/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.\n\n## **4.0 Information Statement**\n\n## **4.1 Assurance Levels and Required Token Types**\n\nThe AAL of a system determines the degree of certainty required when authenticating a user. The following table describes the level of confidence associated with each AAL. These levels of assurance are consistent with those established by the US Federal Government for use by federal agencies. For a full summary of AAL Requirements see Appendix A."}

They are a combination of a physical device (e.g., cellular phone, PDA, pager, land line) and a secret that is transmitted to the device over a distinct communications channel, by a verifier for one-time use.\n\nAn example of an OOB token would be a user logging into a website and receiving a text message or phone call on their cellular phone (pre-registered with the CSP during the registration phase) with a random authenticator to be presented as part of the electronic authentication protocol. E-mail cannot be used to transmit the random authenticator for the OOB device.\n\nAuthenticator Requirements - The device must be possessed and controlled by the user and be uniquely addressable. The authenticator must establish a separate channel with the verifier to retrieve the out-of-band secret or authentication request. The secondary channel is considered out-of-band (even if it terminates on the same device) if the device does not leak information from one channel to the other without authorization from the claimant.\n\nUse of the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is restricted unless the preregistered telephone number in use is associated with a specific physical device. Changing the pre-registered telephone number is equivalent to the binding of a new authenticator and should follow applicable requirements. Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) or email cannot be used for OOB authentication.\n\nToken Requirements - The token must be possessed and controlled by the user, uniquely addressable and must support communication over a channel\/protocol that is separate from the primary channel\/protocol for e-authentication.\n\nUniquely addressable means that the token can be addressed by a unique characteristic (e.g., phone number).\n\nWhen accessing an application via a mobile device and using a virtual phone and communications management system (e.g., Google Voice), then that mobile device will not be viable as an OOB token as there is no separate channel\/protocol for communication of the random authenticator."}

Issued devices are expected to be in active use. Devices which are powered down, disconnected from networks,  or otherwise isolated from ITS management services for extended periods of time must be recorded as lost by the  custodian, unless appropriate arrangements are made for storage when not in use.\n","icl_query_1":"What actions should an agency take if a state-issued laptop is lost or stolen?\n","icl_response_1":"In the event a device is lost, stolen, or otherwise unreturnable, the user or the user\u2019s supervisor must  immediately notify ITS and their agency.

The impacts of such violence are felt in the workplace, regardless of where the incidents are taking place, and have the potential to compromise the safety of victims, co-workers, and clients, while resulting in lost productivity, increased health care costs, absenteeism, and employee turnover. Employers have both a moral and legal obligation to their employees who may be experiencing victimization.\n\nNew York State law recognizes that domestic and gender-based violence occurs within a wide spectrum of relationships, therefore ITS will take every appropriate measure to prevent and\/or address domestic and gender-based violence as it impacts the workplace, while also recognizing the rights of victims to have self-determination and the need to respond in a survivor-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive manner. All valid orders of protection shall be enforced by ITS and all protections of this policy shall apply. This policy shall apply to all victims of gender-based violence, regardless of where the incidents took place.\n\nITS, to the fullest extent possible, without violating any existing rules, regulations, statutory requirements, contractual obligations, or collective bargaining agreements, designates and directs appropriate management, supervisory, and\/or human resources staff to implement the following Gender-Based Violence and the Workplace Policy.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**"}

To do so effectively, system requirements must be identified early and addressed as part of the State Entity's (SE) SSDLC. Failure to identify a requirement until late in the process can have major repercussions to the success of a project and result in project delivery delays, deployment of an inadequate system, and even abandonment of the project. Furthermore, for each phase through which a project passes without identifying and addressing a requirement, the more costly and timeconsuming it will become to fix problems that occur due to the omission.\n\nInformation security must be adequately considered and built into every phase of the SE's SSDLC. Failure to address risks and implement proper controls can result in inadequate security, potentially putting SEs, and the State at large, at risk of data breaches, reputational damage, loss of public trust, compromise to systems\/networks, financial penalties, and legal liability.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies,"}

Designing security into systems requires an investment of time and resources. The extent to which security is applied to the SSDLC process should be commensurate with the classification (data sensitivity and system criticality) of the system being developed and risks the system may introduce into the overall environment. This ensures value to the development process and deliverables. Generally speaking, the best return on investment is achieved by rigorously applying security within the SSDLC process to high risk\/cost projects. Where it is determined that a project will not leverage the full SSDLC process - for example, on a lower-risk\/cost project, the rationale must be documented, and the security activities that are not used must be identified and approved as part of the formal risk acceptance process.\n\nNote: Data classification cannot be used as the sole determinate of whether the project is low risk\/cost. For example, public facing websites cannot be considered low risk\/cost projects even if all the data is public. Public facing websites may be subject to the risk of malware injections, compromise of visitor's machines, or alteration of website content, which could lead to reputational damage.\n\n## **5.0 Compliance**\n\nThis standard shall take effect upon publication.

Establish Digital Identity Requirements**\n\nAs per the NYS-P20-001: Digital Identity Policy, SEs must ensure all applications or systems which require authentication must establish an authorized account credential. Establishing digital identity requirements will ensure that access control of an application or system meets the requirements specified.\n\n## **3. Create a System Configuration Profile and Decompose the System**\n\nThe system or application being developed must be iteratively profiled by technical teams within the SSDLC. A system profile is a high-level overview of the system or application that identifies the system or application's attributes such as the physical topology, the logical tiers, components, services, actors, technologies, external dependencies, and access rights. This profile must be updated throughout the various phases of the SSDLC upon any changes to the design and\/or architecture of the system or application. The system or application must be decomposed into finer components and its mechanics (i.e., the inner workings) must be documented. This activity is to be iteratively performed within the SSDLC. Decomposition should include production data flow and network diagrams to identify trust boundaries, information entry and exit points, data flows, and privileged functions.\n\n## **4. Assess Risks**\n\nAs per the NYS-S14-001: Information Security Risk Management Standard, SEs must iteratively perform risk assessments within the SSDLC process that include vulnerability scanning. Risk assessments begin as an informal, high-level process early in the SSDLC and will evolve throughout the life cycle of the development process. The result is a formal, comprehensive risk assessment process that is executed prior to placing a system or application into production.\n\nAll significant threats and vulnerabilities identified via risk assessments must be addressed by the SE, and SEs must appropriately manage all identified risks by avoiding, transferring, accepting, or mitigating the risk. Ignoring risk is prohibited. Risk assessments must adhere to all relevant state and federal mandates that the SE must document and be compliant with."}

Perform Certification and Accreditation**\n\nThe information security plan must be analyzed, updated, and accepted by SE executive management. All systems and applications are required to undergo periodic risk assessments to ensure they reflect a security posture commensurate with each SEs definition of acceptable risk. Risk assessments must include assessments for compliance with all federal, state, and external compliance standards for which the SE is required to comply.\n\nRisk assessments must be performed after all system and application changes, prior to deployment, and periodically as part of continuous system compliance monitoring.\n\n## **8. Release & Maintenance Support**\n\nAs part of the SSDLC process, the regular upkeep of systems is an important task. Throughout the life cycle of a system or application the following items will need to be considered: regular risk assessment reviews, final network diagrams, attachments of final scans prior to deployment, patch management plans, schedules of continued planning, and plans for OS upgrades and hardware refresh. This is not an all-inclusive list; however, it is important to know that when the system goes live, the iterative nature of the SSDLC process continues throughout its life cycle.\n\nA formal change management process must be followed whenever a system or application is modified in order to avoid direct or indirect negative impacts that the change might impose. The change management process must ensure that all SSDLC security activities are considered and performed, if relevant, and that all SSDLC security controls and documentation that are impacted by the change are updated.\n\nAssociated Standards: NYS-S15-001: Patch Management Standard; NYS-S15-002: Vulnerability Management Standard.\n\n## **9. System Disposal**\n\nThe information contained in systems and applications must be protected once a system or application has reached end of lifecycle and is no longer necessary to perform a SE function. Information must be retained, securely deleted or returned to the SE according to applicable federal and state mandates or other retention requirements. Information without retention requirements must be discarded or destroyed and all disposed media must be sanitized in accordance with applicable federal and state standards, including the NYS-S13-003: Sanitization Secure Disposal Standard, to remove residual information."}

Therefore, before utilizing social media, SEs should consult with their legal counsel and other relevant parties to review the legal issues relevant to their organization. Specifically, SEs must ensure that their technology tools comply with: privacy laws; applicable New York State information technology policies and standards (see section 9.0 below); records retention and archival requirements, where applicable; Freedom of Information policies and laws; requirements of Federal law (including but not limited to the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States); the Hatch Act and\/or New York State Civil Service Law Section 107, and any subsequent amendments, as well as any other applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations; copyrights; and Terms of Service or Use. SEs should also consult with legal counsel to evaluate whether posts or content that a user provides are subject to removal from a social media site before removing them.\n\n## **4.4 Mitigation of Security Risks**\n\nFor successful integration of social media into a SE's operation, the entity's information and systems must be secured against malicious activity. Users must be aware that the use of social media within the organization poses risks that can be mitigated but never fully eliminated. SEs should review the NYS Information Security Policy to help mitigate such risks.\n\nIf available on the platform, SE's must use the strongest multifactor authentication possible to secure their social media account. The preferred methods for implementation of multifactor authentication here are in the following order of precedence: security key; app based one-time password or push notification; =SMS based one-time password.\n\n## **4.5 Personal Use of Social Media**\n\nState employees may share personal views and express themselves as private citizens on social media, but such personal use must make clear that it is not an official act of the employee's SE or New York State. In addition, State employees must not share any confidential, private, or sensitive information pertaining to their SE, other employees, or job activities."}

Identification of Information Assets**\n\nIdentification of information assets must involve creating an inventory of all information assets in the SE. The following items must be considered when constructing this inventory:\n\n**A** Grouping of information assets\n\n**B** Determining the information owner\n\n**C** Determining the information custodian\n\n**D** Identifying information assets\n\n## **A. Grouping of Information Assets**\n\nTo facilitate the classification of information assets and allow for a more efficient application of controls, it may be desirable to appropriately group information assets together. A broad grouping may result in applying controls unnecessarily as the asset must be classified at the highest level necessitated by its individual data elements. For example, if a human resources unit decides to classify all their personnel files as a single information asset and any one of those files contain a name and social security number, the entire grouping would need to be protected with moderate confidentiality controls.\n\nA narrow grouping allows for more precise targeting of controls. However, as there are more information assets to classify, this increases the complexity of the classification and the management of controls. Using the previous example, classifying the multitude of personnel files (e.g., appointment letters, timecards, position classifications, holiday waivers) as individual information assets require a different set of controls for each classification."}

They must also exercise due diligence regarding the proper classification of data to prevent improper disclosure and access.\n\n## **C. Determining the Information Custodian**\n\nInformation custodians are people, units, or organizations responsible f or implementing the authorized controls for information assets based on the classification level. An information asset may have multiple custodians. Based on the information owner's requirements, the custodian secures the information, applying safeguards appropriate to the information's classification level. Information custodians can be from the SE or third parties (e.g., another SE or non-SE). If the custodian is a third party, a formal, written agreement between the custodian's organization and the SE that owns the information must specify the responsibilities of each party. An information custodian may also be the information owner.\n\n## **D. Identifying Information Assets**\n\nFor each information asset in their control, the information owner must identify at a minimum:\n\n\u00b7 Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)\n\n\u00b7 Use of the information asset (i.e., purpose\/business function)"}

Classification of Information Assets**\n\nInformation owners must answer the questions in the Information Asset Classification Worksheet (Appendix A) to determine the classification of their information assets. Questions are categorized by confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each question must be answered sequentially to the best of the information owners' abilities.\n\nInformation owners should consult with subject matter experts who have specific knowledge about the information asset, such as their Counsel's Office and the Records Management Officer. The Information Security Officer (ISO)\/designated security representative may also be called upon to advise and assist the information\n\nowner in determining the classification. An SE may add more questions to the Information Asset Classification Worksheet but may not alter or remove the original questions.\n\nInformation assets are classified according to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Each of these three security principles is individually rated as low, moderate, or high. For example, an information asset may have a confidentiality level of \"high\", an integrity level of \"moderate\", and an availability level of \"low\" (i.e., HML).\n\n## **3. Determination of Controls**\n\nAfter the classification has been determined, the resultant rating is used to determine the security controls required to appropriately protect the information. When determining the appropriate controls, SEs must review and select controls that correspond to the highest information classification rating in any category (e.g., a \"high-water\" mark). For example, a low-impact system is defined as a system in which all three information classification ratings are low. A moderate-impact system is defined as a system in which at least one rating is moderate and no ratings are high. A high-impact system is defined as a system in which at least one rating is high."}

Before deciding the level of resources (e.g., money, time, and technology) required for protection, it is essential that you know what information needs to be protected and the level of protection that is required. The purpose of this supplement is to provide additional guidance on the information classification process.\n\n## **Identifying Information Assets**\n\nAn efficient approach towards identifying information assets is for information owners to maintain an inventory for each information asset in their control. The inventory should minimally include the following:\n\n**1** Source of the information asset (e.g., unit, agency)\n\n**3** Business processes dependent on the information asset\n\n**2** Use of the information asset (e.g., purpose\/business function)\n\n**4** Users\/groups of users of the information asset\n\n**5** Owner of the information asset\n\nInformation assets can be identified using the template provided in Section One of Appendix A or this information can be extracted from an existing information inventory, if available. In place of named individuals, job titles can be used for the custodian, owner, and users to ease maintenance of your information asset inventory. Samples of completed templates are provided below in Figures 1 and 2.\n\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Information Asset Identification       | Information Asset Identification                   |\n| Completed By:                          | John Doe, Assistant Director, Finance Unit         |\n| Completed Date:                        | 10\/10\/2008                                         |\n| Department:                            | Finance                                            |\n| Name of Information Asset:             | Purchase Requisition                               |\n| Information Asset Description\/Comment: | Purchase Requisition                               |\n| Information Asset Use:                 | Track purchases                                    |\n| Information Asset Format:              | Electronic                                         |\n| Information Asset Storage:             | Financial Management System Database               |\n| Source of Information:                 | Requisition and Order Processing Unit              |\n| Business Process(es) Supported:        | Budget\/Finance                                     |\n| Information Owner:                     | John Doe                                           |\n| Information Custodian:                 | Financial Management System Database Administrator |\n| Internal Information User(s):          | Finance Unit                                       |\n| External Information User(s):          | None                                               |\n| Information Asset ID Number:           | 500                                                |\nCaption: Figure 1: Information Asset Identification Template by Single Asset\n"}

If there was an unauthorized release of that information, resulting in an increase of illegal traffic across State borders, it could have a severe impact on the SE's ability to fulfill its mission.\n\nAn example of limited impact would be the release of employee contact information which may result in additional phone calls\/emails\/office visits.\n\nIf a list of local delivery restaurants and their phone numbers is disclosed, there would be no impact.\n\n[6] What impact does unauthorized disclosure of information have on the SE's intangible assets such as the public trust, agency reputation, and public interests?\n\nExample(s): It is important for the government to maintain the public's trust. For example, the unauthorized exposure of medical records from a State-run facility could lead to a loss of the public trust in the State's ability to protect sensitive information.\n\nAn SE which collects and maintains the confidential records of citizens requires a high level of public trust.

For example, it may be important to know whether someone is allergic to specific medications so that they are not administered. In addition, it would be necessary to know whether a person has a particular illness or medical condition which would require special treatment. Malicious or accidental alteration of a patient's health records can cause serious health consequences for that individual. Medical records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate. This rating may be adjusted based on responses to subsequent questions.\n\n[2] Is the information relied upon to make critical security decisions?\n\nExample(s): It is important that security records (e.g., computer security logs, building security access logs) are accurate in order to verify legitimate access and identify unauthorized access attempts. Security related records require a minimum integrity classification of moderate.

It does not strictly mean monetary loss but can also include loss of employee time and effort for recovery. Something that would have severe financial impact might be the loss of all financial records from a State Entity's financial management database.\n\nIf a database of vendor contact information was deleted, it would involve effort in re-creating the database. This would probably be of limited impact.\n\n[5] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the SE mission?\n\nExample(s): State Entity operations could be drastically affected if information is changed without authorization. For example, if someone removed all the phone numbers in a Do Not Call registry, it would severely impact the mission of the program to prevent unwanted calls to registered numbers.\n\nThe mission of a university is to provide education and certify the qualifications of students through academic degrees. Malicious or accidental changes to student academic records would have a severe impact on the university's mission of issuing academic credentials.\n\n[6] What impact does unauthorized modification or destruction of information have on the public trust?\n\nExample(s): The public relies on government to provide accurate information. Failure to do so would erode public trust. For example, if information on certification for licensed professionals was inaccurately modified without authorization and then posted to a public web site, the public would no longer trust the State Entity posting the information as a reputable source for this information.\n\n[7] Is integrity addressed by law or regulation? If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of information.\n\nExample(s): Some types of information, including personal health records, student grades, and financial and personnel records, may be protected by Federal, State, and local laws. Allowing unauthorized changes to information may have legal consequences. There are several key statutes that should be examined based on the information asset being classified. For example, HIPAA requires safeguards to protect against threats to the integrity of electronic protected health information."}

If yes, determine the impact of unauthorized modification or destruction of that information.\n\nExample(s): It is important for financial information to remain reliable. Unauthorized changes to financial transactions (e.g., direct deposit, electronic funds transfer) could severely impact the financial stability of a State Entity.\n\nEmployee appraisal records are used to make important personnel decisions. Someone may attempt to falsify records in hopes of getting a promotion, alternate employment, or to diminish someone else's reputation and\/or record.

Since security is critical, and severe damage can be caused to State Entity data and networks, this operation is time critical and requires high availability (24 hrs. per day\/7 days a week).\n\n[2] What is the impact to health and safety if information were not available when needed?\n\nExample(s): Medical records contain information (e.g., allergies, blood type, previous medications) which is critical for providing patients with accurate medical care. Lack of availability to this data during emergency medical care can lead to life threatening situations therefore placing these items in the high availability (24 hrs. per day\/7 days a week) category.\n\n[3] What is the financial impact if information were not available when needed?\n\nExample(s): For any State Entity where online services generate revenue, a disruption of service can have a financial impact which could be deemed severe.\n\nA personal computer system crash which can be solved by a simple reboot would have limited impact.\n\n[4] What is the impact to the SE mission if information were not available when needed?\n\nExample(s): Public transportation's mission is to get customers quickly and efficiently to various locations. If access to train, bus, and subway schedules was unavailable, this could lead to an inability of public transportation to fulfill its mission. The impact to its mission would be severe.\n\n[5] What is the impact to the public trust if the information were not available when needed?\n\nExample(s): State Entities have spent considerable effort modernizing operations to include online services and encouraging the public to use these services. If these services were seriously degraded or disrupted, this could cause serious embarrassment to the State Entity resulting in a severe impact and an erosion of the public's trust in the SE and the online services. The availability, in this case, would be categorized as high."}

While an SE may adopt a different policy\/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy\/standard and a SE's policy\/standard, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.\n\n## **4.0 Information Statement**\n\nThe standards outlined here most often relate to the hardware and software products allocated to the operation of on-premises data centers, cloud computing, networking and individual end-users (desktops, notebooks, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, software, apps and related peripherals), typically fall into three (3) defining categories:\n\n\u00b7 Solutions Standards . Standards that specify the types of products that can be used (according to manufacturer, version, platform or other defining characteristics), as well as the process by which these standardized products are acquired.\n\n\u00b7 Utilization Standards . Standards that specify the applicability of a given technology product (or set of products) to a demonstrated, stated business need, forming the basis of technology planning, procurement, and product selection recommendations.\n\n\u00b7 Configuration Standards . Standards that specify the way selected devices, software and apps are installed and configured.\n\nStandards encourage use of common platforms or approaches, streamline operational and sustainment activities, enable compliance and security and drive scale to maximize purchasing power. Adhering to technology standards will reduce support logistics and maintenance costs and increase availability by enabling system optimization. Standards may define or limit the tools, proprietary product offerings, or technology protocols which supported state entities may use, develop, or deploy."}

Security logs contain computer security-related information, such as audit logs that track user authentication attempts and user actions, and security device logs that record possible attacks.\n\nSecurity logs are generated by many sources, including but not limited to: security software and firewalls; intrusion detection and prevention systems; databases; applications; and operating systems (OS) on servers, workstations, and networking equipment. The monitoring of logs allows authorized staff to identify security incidents, policy violations, fraudulent activity, and operational problems. This standard defines requirements for security log generation, management, retention, disposal, access, and use.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies,\n\nprotocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .\n\n## **3.0 Scope**"}

Except for personal use that is incidental to official State business (see the examples in Section E of this Policy) , all personal use must be clearly identified as such in the vehicle use log. logs\n\n**2** Each of a trip should be separately recorded in the vehicle use log. For example, if an employee who has an all-day meeting in a different part of the State takes a State vehicle home the evening prior to the meeting; drives to the meeting the next morning; drives home that evening; and returns the vehicle the following morning; she should separately record:  (1) the trip from the official work location to home; (2) the trip from home to the meeting; (3) the trip from the meeting back to home; and (4) the trip from home to the official work location to return the vehicle. leg"}

This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this standard and an SE's standard, the more restrictive standard will take precedence.\n\n## **4.0 Information Statement**\n\n## **4.1 Risk Management Process**\n\nInformation security risk management is an organizational function that considers vulnerabilities, threat sources, identified risks, and security controls within an organization's environment. These factors help determine the resulting level of risk posed to SE information, systems, processes, and individuals that support SE business functions. Risk management and subsequent assessment activities can take many forms (e.g., formal risk assessment, audits, security reviews, configuration analysis, vulnerability scanning and testing, etc.), which all aim to identify and respond to risk in ways that improve an SE's overall security posture. An SE can never completely eliminate risk but can take steps to better manage risk.\n\nThere are four components of a risk management program: risk framing, risk assessment, risk response, and risk monitoring. Each of these components, briefly defined below, are outlined in further detail in subsequent sections.\n\n\u00b7 Risk Framing - establishes the context and common strategy for SE risk management activities.\n\n\u00b7 Risk Response - approved response types to identified risks; and\n\n\u00b7 Risk Assessment - procedures for identifying, categorizing, and prioritizing risk to SE operations, assets, data, and more.\n\n\u00b7 Risk Monitoring - ongoing maintenance activities associated with identified risks."}

Risk framing primarily operates at the organizational tier, while risk assessments can occur at all tiers of the SE. Both risk response and risk monitoring primarily occur at Tiers 2 and 3. However, the SE risk management program may operate differently depending on the SE's mission and other strategic goals.\n\nIt is important to note that information security risk management is dynamic; actions at each organizational tier and risk management function will inform other activities. For example, changes to an SE business process may require changes to an associated information system, requiring a risk assessment. Newly identified risks would require new risk responses and would be incorporated into the SE's risk monitoring activities .\n\n## **4.2 Risk Framing**\n\nRisk framing establishes the SE information security risk management strategy that governs subsequent activities (i.e., assessing, responding to, and monitoring risk). Risk framing activities generally occur at Tier 1 as SE executive management will establish the overarching risk management strategy. Additionally, as required in the NYS-P03-002 Information Security Policy, SEs must designate an individual or team responsible for the risk management function. This function will support the development and implementation of the SE risk management program. There are two primary components of the risk framing function: risk tolerance and governance.\n\n## **4.2.1 Risk Tolerance**\n\nRisk tolerance is the level of residual information security risk, including the environmental context that may influence a risk-based decision (e.g., regulatory requirements, SE mission, budget, etc.), that is acceptable for the organization. The SE risk tolerance governs risk response activities at all organizational tiers as it outlines what risks can be accepted. For example, an SE's risk tolerance will influence\n\nthe decision to use a new service based on the risk that it presents to the organization. Alternatively, the SE's risk tolerance will help to prioritize remediation activities across several existing SE systems."}

It is important to note that defining SE risk tolerance is an executive-level function and cannot be solely defined by Information Technology (IT) professionals unless explicitly delegated by the SE. Defining risk tolerance includes determining who is allowed to accept risk at defined risk levels (low, moderate, high). The SE is still responsible for risk management decisions even if risk tolerance determinations are transferred to an external entity.\n\nSEs must establish organizational mechanisms for implementing the defined risk tolerance. For example, an SE may incorporate risk tolerance criteria into risk assessment and response activities or develop separate procedures to review identified risks and approve recommended risk responses in alignment with SE risk tolerance.\n\nWhere an identified risk affectsmultiple SEs, the strictest risk tolerance must apply. For example, where a risk identified in a system that processes both high confidentiality data for one SE but low confidentiality data for another, the strictest risk tolerance must be implemented, where possible. For risks that affect statewide infrastructure, the IT custodian must be included as a stakeholder.\n\n## **4.2.2 Governance**\n\nGovernance ensures that strategic and operational decisions align with the SE's defined risk tolerance to ensure that risk-based activities are monitored and evolve with the changing threat landscape. The SE must implement mechanisms to monitor risk management processes (e.g., establish and track approved risk assessment methodologies, risk responses, or create risk management procedures) and regularly review performance, at least annually. This review serves two purposes:\n\n**1** Ensuring compliance with the information security risk management strategy (this includes relevant regulatory or business requirements) of the SE; and\n\n**2** Identifying potential changes required to the SE risk management strategy.\n\nSE information security risk management activities should align with the processes used for other types of risk (e.g., financial, legal) to incorporate information security risk into existing strategic activities. SE information security risk management is only one type of risk that an SE must manage and should be prioritized as part of overarching strategic activities."}

Additional benefits to conducting regular risk assessments include:\n\n\u00b7 Current risk assessments ensure timely, relevant information that enables SE leadership to make informed, real-time risk management decisions;\n\n\u00b7 Reduced cost of future assessments and support of ongoing risk monitoring activities; and\n\n\u00b7 Reduces assessment scope. Incremental risk assessments consider only new information and differential risk assessments consider how changes affect the overall risk determination.\n\n## **4.4 Risk Response**\n\nOnce a risk has been assessed, the SE must determine and implement the appropriate course of action. Options include:\n\n**1** Risk Acceptance - This is a documented decision not to act on a specific risk at the time of assessment. Acceptance is not negligence or \"inaction\" and can be appropriate if the risk falls within the SE's defined risk tolerance. A risk acceptance response must be reviewed periodically as part of the requirements outlined in the risk monitoring section below. For example, choosing to accept the risk of an earthquake, based on the high cost of preventative controls and the low likelihood of occurrence of an earthquake in a given area.\n\n**3** Risk Mitigation\/Reduction - These are specific actions taken to eliminate or reduce risk to an acceptable level. This is the most common approach and is appropriate where controls can reduce the identified risk. For example, a firewall is installed to reduce the risk of network intrusion."}

ESRA also allows a process\n\nto create an e-signature, when a system used to create a signed e-record associates the recorded events of accessing an application with the content to be signed, creating a virtual record of the signer's actions and intent. Such signing processes may also use a password, PIN, or other digital object to authenticate the signer."}

Under ESRA, e-signatures are viewed as \"attached to or logically associated with an electronic record\" if the e-signature is linked to the record during transmission and storage, achieved by various means. For instance, an e-signature can be a discrete digital object that is part of the document the same as for an ink signature, or can be an object associated with the document through an embedded link, or be maintained separately but logically associated with the record through a database, index, or other means.\n\nWhen a process serves as an e-signature, the system used to create a signed erecord logically associates all the signed record's components, e.g., when a document is created with an official's sign-on to a procurement system where the official has only been authorized to access the system to create signed procurement documents, and the official's authority to sign is embedded in the system. The record is created through a sign-on authentication using a PIN or password with the official's actions captured while accessing the system. The record exists conceptually as a 'document' in the system, but the various pieces of the \"record\" may be maintained in various databases and system logs. The collection and maintenance of different informational pieces, along with the official's intent to sign the record, creates an e-signature under ESRA.\n\nUnder ESRA the attachment or logical association between signed record and signature must be created at the point a record is signed, maintained during transmission of the signed record, and retained as long as the signed record is needed including subsequent storage. Creation of the e-signature, including its attachment or logical association to the signed record, can occur outside the government entity's system. A private sector entity regularly submitting reports to a government agency might have an internal system housing and formatting electronic reports, with an authorized signer e-signing such reports at one point in time, and a government entity electing to accept those signed reports when they are later electronically submitted later."}

Under ESRA, while e-signatures must show the same intent as signatures affixed by hand, ESRA doesn't require any specific level or method of signer identification (\"ID\") or authentication, so government entities are free to select such methods as meet their needs. Selecting an appropriate identification and authentication approach is one consideration in selecting an esignature solution.\n\nA signer's intent can be captured in many ways, such as automatically captured and documented by the signer's actions after entering an information system. But to avoid confusion as to signer intent, rather than rely solely on system recordation, government entities might adopt a number of other simple practices:\n\n\u00b7 Prior to applying an e-signature, afford the signer an opportunity to review the entire document or content to be signed.\n\n\u00b7 Format e-signed records to contain similar signature elements as in paper records so a reader may readily identify the significance of the signature at the bottom.\n\n\u00b7 Make it impossible for an e-signature to be applied to a document without the signer having been informed that a signature is being applied.\n\n\u00b7 Allow the signer's intent to be expressed as part of the record or in a certification statement submitted with and linked to the signed record.\n\n\u00b7 Record the date, time, and fact that the signer indicated their intent and retain this information for evidentiary purposes. This may be different than the time the signer accessed the application or was authenticated.\n\n\u00b7 Require the signer to act affirmatively to indicate assent to the document being signed, such as requiring the signer to click an \"Accept\" button, choose between that and a \"Reject\" button to show that a choice was made, or alternately be required to type specific words of acceptance (e.g., \"I ACCEPT\" or \"I AGREE\").\n\nBelow is an example of a generic signature attestation\/affirmation statement that can be modified for use with specific e-signature applications."}

The device is read contact-less by a radio frequency reader or inserted into a computer or network microchip detector. The device's chip is read by security software once the person enters a PIN, password, or biometric identifier, providing greater security than using a PIN alone, as it requires both physical possession of the smart card and knowledge of the PIN. The PIN, password, or biometric identifier is a secret shared between the person and the microchip device, not between the user and a computer. Microchip devices can be used to further augment the security of a shared secret approach to e-signatures or used in combination with digital signatures.\n\n\u00b7 Hybrid, and New Approaches: Hybrid solutions combine techniques to increase security, authentication, record integrity, and non-repudiation of less secure esigning methods. A solution might use improved signature-capture techniques combined with click wrap, PINs, and password approaches, while another might use click wrap to encrypt a signature object within read-only document. Esignature solutions requiring high levels of security and non-repudiation might combine the strong authentication of a one-time password token with hashing techniques. Responding to changes in the market, legal, or fiscal environments, new approaches are continually developed. Commercially offered e-signature solutions have matured, with several available that may be compatible with ESRA."}

Under ESRA, when selecting e-signature approaches for given transactions government entities should support the public's interest in using sound and appropriate practices in governmental e-transactions. While they need not be submitted to ITS for approval, ESRA regulation 9 NYCRR \u00a7540.4(c) requires governmental entities to document and maintain a \"business analysis and risk assessment\" (\"BA\/RA\"), defined in the regulation as: \"identifying and evaluating various factors relevant to the selection of an electronic signature for use or acceptance in an electronic transaction. Such factors include, but are not limited to, relationships between parties to an electronic transaction, value of the transaction, risk of intrusion, risk of repudiation of an electronic signature, risk of fraud, functionality and convenience, business necessity and the cost of employing a particular electronic signature process.\"\n\nThe regulatory elements are not a checklist, but rather factors to consider during the BA\/RA process. Governmental entities may evaluate each factor differently, accord them different weights based on the specifics of the underlying transaction, and even decide that a particular factor has no weight for a particular transaction. ESRA regulations don't stipulate the extent, level of detail, or format of the required BA\/RA. Governmental entities may use their own processes for conducting these assessments, evaluating their specific business needs, risks, and impacts. The regulation also allows governmental entities to collaborate and conduct joint BA\/RAs when selecting appropriate e-signature solutions for e-transactions common to such entities. For the same type of e-transaction, they may adopt as their own another governmental entities BA\/RA.

When applying risk management principles to e-records, consider: if erecords were lost or unavailable, how would it impact entity operations, including the entity or others suffering financial loss; the likelihood the e-records would be subject or relevant to a legal action; an inability to produce the e-records in admissible form in court having a critical impact on a case's outcome; and, whether the e-records are needed for extended time periods, for business reasons or their significant cultural or historical value.\n\n**4**3.1.3 Focusing on E-records Systems and Business Processes: To demonstrate e-record authenticity and integrity, the reliability and accuracy of the systems, processes, and procedures producing and maintaining them are critical, and more important than the format, medium, or technology used.

While some don't require authenticating the sender, if required, there are generally three means to do so, used alone or in combination, concerning something the individual: knows (e.g., a secret, password, PIN, or cryptographic key); possesses (e.g., a token, ATM card or a smart card); or is (e.g., biometric characteristics such as their unique voice pattern or fingerprint). For low to moderate risk applications, typically authentication is done with unique passwords and\/or PINs, or unique personal information. Higher risk applications often rely on \"two-factor\" authentication combining a PIN and something the user \"possesses\" or \"is.\"\n\nConfirming receipt, and documenting date\/time: Some records require confirming document receipt, which varies in relation to the type of application. Webbased applications may return a screen confirming a transaction with a unique tracking\/auditing number. High security e-records might confirm separately via alternate routes, e.g., a person's postal address confirmed via an external database and receipt confirmation sent via mail or courier (e.g., FedEx, UPS). Also, some government transactions require documenting date\/time receipt information, like a time stamp used on a paper record. This is usually captured automatically by the receiving system, but for high-risk applications, a neutral or trusted third party can apply secure time stamping binding electronic date and time to a record using public key cryptography."}

The e-signature method selected will partially determine the approaches needed to ensure the trustworthiness of the e-signed e-record over time. In \"Guidance on Managing Digital Identity Authentication Records,\" the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has identified practices used by Federal agencies, including: maintaining adequate documentation of an esignature's validity gathered at or near the time the e-record was signed, where, depending on the signing method, this contextual information may actually be part of the signed e-record or captured in supporting records; or maintaining the ability to revalidate e-signatures (requiring agencies to retain the capability to revalidate the e-signature, along with retaining the signed e-record). As with any e-record, acceptance of signed e-records for legal, audit, and other purposes depends on demonstrating the trustworthiness of the system used to produce them, and, maintaining the ability to revalidate e-signatures is only available where the esignature method relies primarily on a digital object that can be revalidated (e.g., an encrypted hash, a digitized signature, or a biometric). Retaining all records of the system's functionality specific to a particular e-signature technology or approach is needed for the revalidation process to be successful. For digital signatures produced with PKI, ensure the PKI is governed by a certificate policy addressing all aspects of a digital certificate's generation, management, use, and storage as well as the roles and responsibilities of all entities involved in the PKI. And, regardless of approach used, retain documentation of the signer's identity; how, and the date\/time, they were authenticated; signer's intent; and date\/time the signing process was completed."}

This requirement reflects the recognition that citizens and businesses must be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit State Agency Websites. Pursuant to section 203(1) of the STL, ITS has specified a model Internet privacy policy for use by SEs.\n\nThis guideline highlights a number of considerations that should be taken into account in drafting an Internet privacy policy and provides an outline for the contents of an Internet privacy policy. This guideline may be used by each SE, in conjunction with the ISPA and ITS' model policy, to draft Internet privacy policies that accurately describe the practices and procedures relating to the information they collect about users through the State Agency Website and to the SE's retention and disclosure of that information.\n\nThe attached model Internet privacy policy was drafted using this guideline. This model is not intended to reflect the actual practices and procedures of any particular SE and should not be adopted by any SE without an analysis of whether the example accurately describes the SE's practices and procedures.\n\n## **4.2 Basic Requirements for an Internet Privacy Policy**"}

If unnecessary\n\ninformation is being collected through the website, the SE should revise its practices and procedures to eliminate the collection of that information.\n\nBecause State Agency Website includes websites operated on behalf of SEs by other public or private entities, it would be appropriate for the SE to evaluate, in the manner described in the preceding paragraphs of this section, the practices and procedures of any entities with which it contracts for the operation of all, or a portion, of the SE's website. Existing contracts with other entities to operate websites on behalf of the SE may include language requiring compliance with all applicable laws, and the SE should inform those entities of the requirements of the ISPA.

For example:\n\n\"The Agency does not knowingly collect personal information from children or create profiles of children through this website. Users are cautioned, however, that the collection of personal information submitted in electronic mail will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access. The Agency strongly encourages parents and teachers to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance whenever children are asked to provide personal information online.\"\n\nIf the State Agency Website includes an area specifically intended for use by children or if any of the transactions offered on the website are available to children, the SE should be conscious of the rules adopted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) pursuant to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). While COPPA generally applies only to commercial websites, the FTC encourages others to post policies and provide protections that comply with COPPA if children provide personal information at their sites. Information concerning COPPA and the FTC rules is available at\n\n**https:\/\/www**ftc.gov\/tips-advice\/business-center\/privacy-andsecurity\/children's-privacy\n\n**b** The SE may also wish to include contact information in the event that users have questions about the policy. At the SE's discretion, the contact for questions about the Internet privacy policy may be the employee designated to be responsible for compliance with the PPPL pursuant to section 94(1)(j) of the Public Officers Law.\n\n**c** It may also be advisable for the Internet privacy policy to clearly state that websites to which the user may be linked from the State Agency Website are not subject to that policy and providing information that links to NYS authentication services is subject to the privacy policies of such authentication service.

By applying security related software or firmware updates (patches) to applicable IT systems, the expected result is reduced time and money spent dealing with exploits by reducing or eliminating the related vulnerability.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117, established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in New York State (NYS) ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines .\n\n## **3.0 Scope**\n\nThis standard applies to all \"State Entities\" (SE), defined as \"State Government\" entities in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or \"State Agencies\" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any ITS resource for which ITS or the SE has administrative responsibility, including"}

Part-time employees whose annualized full-time salary would exceed the threshold (but whose actual compensation is less) are required to file an FDS. The FDS requires filers to provide information concerning their personal financial interests, including but not limited to, a list of major assets, sources of income, liabilities, names of spouses and unemancipated children, whether they are licensed by or do business with a State agency, offices held with a political party, sources of gifts, reimbursements, trusts, deferred income, and real property. An FDS is a publicly available record; however, the Commission automatically redacts a filer's home address and the name of any minor child. In addition, employees may request that the Commission redact specific information from the copy made publicly available, or not answer specific questions on the FDS regarding a spouse or minor child. The FDS is usually filed around May 15th of each calendar year in which the required filers are employed by New York State, and within 30 days of beginning employment for new employees. A filer may request an extension of time to file an FDS on the basis of justifiable cause or undue hardship. The Commission can exempt from filing individuals at Salary Grade 24 or higher who are not policymakers and who do not perform certain job duties. The Ethics Officer maintains a list of titles for which the Commission has granted an FDS filing exemption. This list is available upon request.\n\n## **4.3 Restrictions Concerning Conflicts of Interests**\n\nEmployees may not engage in activities that would create or appear to create a conflict with their public duties.

It provides instructions on how to draft formal documents without using unnecessary gender-specific language.\n\nThis guidance also provides specific instructions regarding State Entity implementation of A.1371-A\/S.208-A of 2023, which requires agencies to use gender-neutral terminology on their websites.\n\n## **B. Gender Inclusive Language Policy**\n\nPursuant to A.1371-A\/S.208-A of 2023, as amended by Chapter 21 of the Laws of New York of 2024, State Entities are required to avoid the use of gender-specific language - such as \"he,\" \"she,\" \"his,\" and \"her\" - on all website content created on or after July 24, 2024. This applies to all website content, including forms accessible through the website, that is created by or on behalf of an agency, or is within an agency's control to modify. While this requirement applies only to website content create on or after July 24, 2024, agencies should also, wherever possible, make updates to older content as well.\n\nIn addition to website content, State Entities should also avoid the use of genderspecific language and should adhere to these guidelines when drafting laws, proposed legislation, rules, regulations, reports, policies, and other formal documents.\n\n**a** When conducting reviews of and making amendments to existing laws, legislation, rules, regulations, reports, policies, and other formal documents, State Entities should also, where possible, make updates to remove and replace any gender-specific language from the provision(s) being amended.\n\n**b** If amending portions of existing law with gender-neutral terminology, State Entities should also review the entire section of law to ensure that changes are not creating confusion or conflict with other language within the section and should make additional conforming amendments as needed.\n\n**c** For purposes of this policy, \"State Entities\" shall mean (i) all agencies and departments over which the Governor has\n\nexecutive authority and as defined in subdivision 3, section 2a of the State Finance Law; and (ii) all public benefit corporations, public authorities, boards, and commissions f or which the Governor appoints the Chair, the Chief Executive, or at least 50% of the entity's board members, commissioners or comparable officers.\n\n## **C. Gender-Specific Nouns**\n\n(i) State Entities should avoid using nouns that are genderspecific, and should , where possible, use substitutes of the same meaning. See Section F for exceptions.\n\n**a** Gender-specific nouns and possible substitutes include but are not limited to:"}

Part of managing these accounts means maintaining standardized offboarding of User accounts upon State employee, contractor, or consultant (collectively referred to herein as \"User(s)\") separation from ITS or a Client Agency.\n\nOffboarding is the process used to revoke accounts and access from separating Users. Proper offboarding is necessary to facilitate the appropriate deactivation of accounts, to ensure ITS and Client Agencies meet their legal obligations on this topic, and to secure the return of all ITS-owned equipment and assets. Proper offboarding also ensures the security of state resources and data.\n\nThis policy outlines the importance of appropriate offboarding, defines specific types of offboarding, and ultimately establishes a collaborative workflow that involves ITS technical staff, ITS Enterprise eDiscovery Services (\"EES\"), and Client Agency legal counsel, or their designee.\n\n## **$^{ }$2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 1 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, charges the State Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\") with overseeing and supervising the management and operations of ITS . Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS\n\nresponsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .\n\n## **3.0 Scope**\n\nThis policy applies to ITS employees, contractors, consultants, and ITS supported agencies (\"Client Agency\").\n\nThis policy applies to the User account(s) assigned to a specific User. $_{4.0 Information Statement }$"}

SSNs are commonly used in identity theft and fraud. Changes to the New York State Labor Law and Public Officers Law in 2009 and 2010 implemented controls on the collection and transmission of SSNs by the State and its political subdivisions. These changes to the Labor Law and Public Officers Law reduce the potential for SSNs from being subject to unauthorized disclosure.\n\nSince 1983, the New York State Personal Privacy Protection Law (PPPL), codified in Article 6-A of the Public Officers Law, has required State agencies to maintain in their records only the personal information relevant and necessary to accomplish a purpose of such agencies: (1) as required to be accomplished by statute or executive order, or (2) as required to implement a program specifically authorized by law. Further, the PPPL obligates agencies to ensure the integrity and security of personal information maintained in their records. Chapter 279 of the Laws of 2008 amended the PPPL and the Labor Law to extend to public entities certain prohibitions already applicable to commercial entities and to establish specific requirements applicable for the use and transmission of SSNs. More specifically, Chapter 279 added Section 96-a of the Public Officers Law and Section 203-d of the Labor Law."}

This guidance was originally issued by the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) after consultation with the former New York State Consumer Protection Board, the New York State Department of Labor, and the former New York State Office of Cyber Security and Critical\n\nInfrastructure Coordination (now a part of ITS). These agencies, or their successors, have certain responsibilities concerning the privacy and security of personal identifying information, such as SSNs, used by State government entities. Per statute, an employer's failure to establish policies or procedures to safeguard against privacy breaches may be presumptive evidence of a violation. State government entities may wish to adopt agency level policies not inconsistent with these guidelines to avoid allegations of breach and imposition of authorized penalties.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**\n\nChapter 279 of the Laws of 2008 contained changes to the New York State Labor Law which went into effect on January 3, 2009, and changes to the New York State Public Officers Law, Article 6-A (Personal Privacy Protection Law), which went into effect January 1, 2010, governing the use of SSNs by state agencies and political subdivisions. Many of these changes concern the use of SSNs in technology systems, including the Internet, websites, and electronic mail.\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 provides the State Chief Information Officer the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy NYSP08-002, Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines."}

Mobile technology enables users to not only send and receive voice calls, email, and text messages, but also allows them to access business data and applications from anywhere at any time. Users whose job responsibilities frequently take them away from the office can take full advantage of mobile technology solutions to conduct State business, communicate effectively, and securely access New York State (\"NYS\" or \"State\") data when required.\n\nThis mobile device policy (\"Policy\"), issued by the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS), sets forth mobile device provisioning and deprovisioning processes; defines standard vs non-standard mobile devices, including accessories; sets forth the billing process for device counts in excess of the established baseline; and establishes a mobile device repair\/replacement policy for a device that is inoperable, lost or stolen.\n\nITS strives to provide a high quality, sustainable, secure, and cost-effective mobile experience through issuing mobile standards and normalized rate plans. ITS mobile service rates can be found at https:\/\/its.ny.gov\/service-rates. Additionally, this Policy will ensure the State's mobile technology assets are deployed appropriately and consistently. 1\n\n## **2.0 Authority**"}

This plan should be regularly maintained and re-certified to reflect any changes in Agency mobile device needs.\n\nMobile Device Provisioning Guidelines: The following user roles are approved for mobile devices:\n\n\u00b7 Mobile workforce - Users of Unit A are in travel status approximately 40% of the time. To perform their job duties effectively, they are expected to regularly respond to e-mail communications, even when in travel status.\n\n\u00b7 On-call workforce - Users of Unit B are required to be reachable via phone call during off-hours.\n\no Approved device type: smartphone\n\no Approved device type: cell phone\n\no Approved device type: MiFi\n\n\u00b7 Emergency response team - Users of Unit C are part of an emergency response team, and often need to perform work in a location different from their normal workstation. Given that data connectivity may not be readily available, a portable data connection is needed.\n\n\u00b7 Emergency vehicles - Unit D has a fleet of vehicles that are used to perform everyday business functions. The users working in unit D do not have their own individual State-issued cell phones.\n\no Approved device type: cell phone to be left in vehicle\n\nExceptions to One Data Plan Limitation: Per ITS-P18-007, the Agency will not authorize more than one data plan per user. The following is a list of users that have more than one data plan, and associated justification that describes the reason why the direction per ITS P18-007 cannot be followed:\n\nApprovals for Mobile Devices: Per ITS-P18-007, the Agency is responsible for ensuring that the business and financial approval of all Agency mobile devices is in accordance with this Plan."}

ITS's Client Agencies are subject to a myriad of statutory and regulatory compliance requirements including IRS Publication 1075, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the Privacy Act, and the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy. Often, the compliance requirements established by these statutory and regulatory frameworks are passed down to ITS's Client Agencies through data sharing or computer matching agreements. In other cases, the receipt of federal financial participation is conditioned upon adhering to such requirements. As a result, ITS is asked to provide technical reviews of our systems for alignment with these compliance requirements and\/or execute agreements with our Client Agencies. This Policy is to establish a support model for ITS when Client Agencies request ITS support for the review and execution of data sharing or computer matching agreements.\n\n## **2.0 Authority**\n\nSection 1 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, charges the State Chief Information Officer (CIO) with overseeing and supervising the management and"}

Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS.

For purposes of this Policy, requests regarding the described items below must be directed to the ITS Division of Legal Affairs (\"DLA\") at its.sm.dla@its.ny.gov before any commitments to the Client Agency are made on ITS's behalf.\n\nMany ITS Client Agencies have computer matching, data sharing, or similar types of agreements with various federal, state, local, and private entities whereby these entities exchange electronic information and data with the Client Agencies, or vice versa. Often, these agreements include statutory or regulatory compliance requirements for the information technology systems that receive, process, store, and transfer the data to and from the entity to the Client Agency. ITS, as the agency primarily responsible for the management of those systems, is often asked to execute the agreements; however, with different entities having different language in each of the agreements, it is not always appropriate for ITS to be a party to the agreement. Below are the five (5) most common scenarios regarding these agreements and how ITS will respond to each:\n\na) For agreements where ITS, or the Client Agency's centralized information technology provider, is a required party, ITS will jointly execute the agreement with the Client Agency and the third party.\n\nc) For agreements, new or old, that include information security addenda, or similar, ITS will sign the addenda, but not the underlying agreement unless specified above and where ITS provides information security services to the Client Agency."}

This is the case even if the SE's website is hosted by a private entity. Before permitting any advertising on an SE website, the SE should consult with its legal counsel to determine whether it has the requisite express or implicit authority and whether such advertising would further the SE's purpose or mission.\n\n## **4.2 Banner Ads, Pop Ups and Vendor-Hosted Website Advertising**\n\nBanner Ads, Pop Up Ads, and vendor-hosted website advertising create the following issues which should be assessed by the SE's legal counsel:\n\n\u00b7 Advertising for private individuals, firms, or corporations can imply that the SE endorses or favors a specific commercial product, commodity, or service. Citizens expect their government to be impartial. Businesses and for-profit entities also expect to be treated fairly by the government. Endorsing some commercial products and services, while excluding others, may constitute preferential treatment.\n\n\u00b7 Privacy violations may occur when a user accesses web advertisement. This is because advertisers frequently engage in behavioral targeting of web users through data collection. Some websites record information about users by automatically depositing a piece of information in the \"cookie\" file on the user's computer. The cookie helps track information communicated between the user's browser and the server."}

Since the data in this level does not reside on the BYOD device, no State management of the BYOD device is required.\n\n## **4.2 Application Access**\n\nIn the application model, all access to State data from the BYOD device is delivered via applications, which securely isolate State data from personal data on the BYOD device. Application examples include Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) or terminal clients that do not store State data, web browsers, or applications that encrypt data stored on the BYOD devices (e.g., a State employee accesses a SE managed desktop (physical or virtual) with a Secure Socket Layer Virtual Private Network (SSL-VPN) client). In this instance, the SE manages the BYOD device and access method.\n\nApplications used in this manner must have the following capabilities:\n\n**1** Applications must not store plaintext State data on the BYOD device. Any State data stored on the BYOD device must be stored in a manner consistent with relevant security policies and encryption standards.\n\n**2** Applications must disallow access to State data from other applications on the BYOD device, unless access is secured in a manner consistent with relevant security policies and encryption standards.\n\n## **4.3 Native Messaging and Calendar Access**\n\nIn the messaging access model, end users are authorized to connect BYOD devices to State messaging platforms using approved methods.\n\nTo allow this type of connectivity, BYOD devices must have the following capabilities:"}

If a device is replaced, the replacement device will be materially similar in function and may be new,  used, or refurbished.\nClient Agency funded devices, supported by ITS, which are replaced outside of a warranty period must be funded by the Client Agency.\n4.4 Lost or Stolen Devices In the event a device is lost, stolen, or otherwise unreturnable, the user or the  user\u2019s supervisor must immediately notify ITS and their agency. ITS will confirm data encryption and update the  statewide inventory, noting the device\u2019s status. The user must also consult their agency\u2019s Chief Legal Counsel  regarding their agency\u2019s legal obligations related to a lost or stolen device, as well as compliance with the  Office of the State Comptroller\u2019s Guide to Financial Operations Chapter XII.10.E \u2013 Reporting the Theft, Loss  or Misuse of State Assets, if applicable. ITS does not report a Client Agency\u2019s lost or stolen device to the  Office of the State Comptroller.\n4.5 Compromised Devices If a device is potentially compromised, the user or other custodian must notify the  agency\u2019s Chief Legal Counsel to arrange return. It is the responsibility of the Client Agency to attempt  recovery of the device and notify ITS to arrange return to ITS. ITS will confirm data encryption and update  the statewide inventory, noting the device\u2019s status. A compromised device is a device that was left outside  of the care of the assigned user due to the death, incarceration, or other unusual circumstance leaving the  user unable to return the device. 4.5 Device Management Devices issued to custodians must be managed by using an ITS designated configuration management solution and joined to a designated directory service. Issued devices are expected to be in active use. Devices which are powered down, disconnected from networks,  or otherwise isolated from ITS management services for extended periods of time must be recorded as lost by the  custodian, unless appropriate arrangements are made for storage when not in use.\n","icl_query_1":"What actions should an agency take if a state-issued laptop is lost or stolen?\n","icl_response_1":"In the event a device is lost, stolen, or otherwise unreturnable, the user or the user\u2019s supervisor must  immediately notify ITS and their agency.
