## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This policy establishes the procedure for interested parties to challenge the outcome or nature of a proposed contract or procurement award made by the New York State (NYS) Office of Information Technology Services (ITS)

Bidders are encouraged to take advantage of the debriefing process, which allows vendors to learn how their bid was evaluated and potential improvements for future bids. Bidders are also encouraged to use the Question-and-Answer   periods during procurements to raise concerns to bid evaluation and award. prior

ITS strives to ensure a fair, open; and competitive process to all vendors qualified to respond to any competitive procurement issued by ITS. In furtherance of this goal, this policy is established to provide any interested party involved in any contract or procurement award protest the ability to receive due and fair consideration where it presents a factual andlor legal basis for challenging a contract or procurement award made by ITS.

Section 1 of Executive Order No. 1171 established January 2002 charges the State Chief Information Officer with overseeing and supervising the management and operations of ITS. Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be

found in NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards, and Guidelines.
