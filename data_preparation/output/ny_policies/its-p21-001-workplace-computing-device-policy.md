| ITS Policy :                                        |
| Workplace Computing  Device                         |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) was established in 2012 to provide centralized technology services to customer agencies, set New York State's (NYS) technology standards, and coordinate and govern statewide technology-related initiatives, thereby improving the efficiency of New York State government.

ITS strives to provide high quality, secure, and cost-effective technology in support of state agencies and their missions. With respect to workplace computing devices, this is achieved by standardizing configurations, accommodating exceptions in a consistent manner, and managing asset lifecycles in a defined, consistent interval.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This Policy applies to ITS, its employees, contractors, and consultants, and ITS supported agencies (Client Agency) for which ITS provides workplace computing related services for employee, contractor, and consultant use.

Mobile devices such as cell phones, smartphones, cellular access points, and tablets, generally accompanied by service plans are covered by the ITS-P18-007 Mobile Device Provisioning, Deprovisioning, and Replacement Policy.

## 4.0 Information Statement

ITS provides workplace computing devices, select peripherals (i.e., keyboards, mouse, etc.), support, maintenance, and management services to deliver secure access to applications supporting Client Agency missions.

## 4.1 Device and Peripheral Standards and Selection

The ITS Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) defines and maintains standardized device and peripheral categories. These standards are published in the Enterprise IT Service Management System (ITSM) Service Catalog and are designed to meet 90% of Client Agency device needs.

## 4.1.1 Device Categories and Funded Service Life Objectives

Funded Service Life Objectives (FSLO) are the projected useful life of the device, starting on the procurement date of the device.


| Category                     | FSLO    |

| Tablet Keyboard / Case | Concurrent with Device |

## 4.1.3 Exceptions

Standardization is designed to broadly meet the needs of the user community in the most cost-effective way possible. Specialized use cases will be accommodated via an exception request and may require additional Client Agency funding.

Exception requests must include factors such as operational requirements or business need. An exception may be requested, via the ITSM Service Catalog, for approval by the ITS Chief Technology Officer, or their designee.

## 4.2 Device Issuance

## 4.2.1 Individual Assignment

For use cases where a device will be principally used by a single individual, ITS will assign one (1) device, and associated peripherals, to each individual.

The user and Client Agency, as custodians of the device, are expected to take reasonable measures to ensure that the device and associated peripherals are appropriately cared for.

ITS will re-assign devices upon request. The custodian must at least annually recertify assignment and location of issued devices though a process established by ITS, and report loss or damage to ITS in a timely manner.

## 4.2.2 Location or Asset Based Assignment

For use cases where a device will be used by one or more users, in a single physical location or within a larger asset (e.g., a vehicle, boat, trailer, etc.), ITS will assign devices as appropriate.

The Client Agency, as custodian of the device, is expected to take reasonable care to ensure that the device and associated peripherals are appropriately cared for. ITS will re-assign devices upon request. The custodian must at least annually re-certify assignment and location of issued devices, and report loss or damage to ITS in a timely manner.

## 4.2.2 Peripherals

Standard peripherals associated with computing devices will be issued based on standard service offerings, as defined in the ITSM Service Catalog.

Additional peripherals, where appropriate may require additional Client Agency funding.

## 4.2.2.1 Out of Scope Peripherals

Peripherals outside of the ITSM Service Catalog offerings as well as Consumables, including batteries or routine maintenance parts not covered by warranty or service contract, are out of scope and are not funded by ITS.

The funding and procurement of out-of-scope peripherals are the responsibility of the Client Agency. This includes Reasonable Accommodation requests that are for out-of-scope peripherals. ITS will use reasonable efforts to support peripherals and, where Client agency funding is available, ITS may incorporate Client Agency funded peripherals into device procurements to maximize value.

## 4.3 Device Replacement

In the event that a device fails, the device will be repaired or replaced at the discretion of ITS. If a device is replaced, the replacement device will be materially similar in function and may be new, used, or refurbished.

Client Agency funded devices, supported by ITS, which are replaced outside of a warranty period must be funded by the Client Agency.

## 4.4 Lost or Stolen Devices

In the event a device is lost, stolen, or otherwise unreturnable, the user or the user's supervisor must immediately notify ITS and their agency. ITS will confirm data encryption and update the statewide inventory, noting the device's status. The user must also consult their agency's Chief Legal Counsel regarding their agency's legal obligations related to a lost or stolen device, as well as compliance with the Office of the State Comptroller's Guide to Financial Operations Chapter XII.10.E - Reporting the Theft, Loss or Misuse of State Assets, if applicable. ITS does not report a Client Agency's lost or stolen device to the Office of the State Comptroller.

## 4.5 Compromised Devices

If a device is potentially compromised, the user or other custodian must notify the agency's Chief Legal Counsel to arrange return. It is the responsibility of the Client Agency to attempt recovery of the device and notify ITS to arrange return to ITS. ITS will confirm data encryption and update the statewide inventory, noting the device's status. A compromised device is a device that was left outside of the care of the assigned user due to the death, incarceration, or other unusual circumstance leaving the user unable to return the device.

## $^{ }$4.5 Device Management

Devices issued to custodians must be managed by using an ITS designated configuration management solution and joined to a designated directory service.

Issued devices are expected to be in active use. Devices which are powered down, disconnected from networks, or otherwise isolated from ITS management services for extended periods of time must be recorded as lost by the custodian, unless appropriate arrangements are made for storage when not in use.

## 4.6 Deprovisioning Computing Devices

ITS is responsible for maintaining an accurate inventory of available and allocated computing devices. This inventory enables ITS to provide the necessary computing devices to Client Agencies - ensuring that agency users have the tools they need to properly serve the citizens and businesses of New York State.

It is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly offboard its users upon separation from the agency, to return/replace devices no longer needed, and to coordinate with the agency's Chief Legal Counsel regarding preservation obligations before proceeding with deprovisioning requests to ITS. Whether the user leaves state service or simply

transfers to a new agency, the Client Agency must promptly complete and submit an Employee Offboarding request through the ITSM Service Catalog which provides ITS Workplace Services (WPS) the necessary information to reclaim and re-allocate the computing device.

For devices no longer needed, the Client Agency must promptly complete and submit an appropriate service request through the ITSM Service Catalog and ship the device to the address provided in ITSM. Before a Client Agency submits a request to offboard a user or replace a user's computing device, it should first consult with the Chief Legal Counsel of the Client Agency to ensure all legal preservation obligations are met.

Devices no longer in use by a Client Agency must be returned to ITS, unless directed otherwise by the Client Agency's Chief Legal Counsel due to legal preservation obligations.

## 4.7 Disposal

Devices issued by or transferred to ITS are the property of ITS. At the end of a device's service life, devices must be disposed of by ITS. In the event that legal, operational, security, or other business needs require that a Client Agency retain the device past its useful operational life, ownership of the device must be transferred to that Client Agency.

At the time of disposal, ITS will sanitize all hard drive and storage devices under its control according to NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. It is the responsibility of the custodian to provide an accurate data classification prior to disposal. If ownership of the device is transferred to the Client Agency as outlined above, sanitization and disposal of the device will become the responsibility of the Client Agency.
