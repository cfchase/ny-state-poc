## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This policy sets forth the process for establishing technology standards for NYS government entities that receive information technology services from the New York State Office of Information Technology Services (ITS). Technology standards establish boundaries for technology usage, specifying technology to be used ("acceptable" use) and restricting access to technology that is deemed " exception " or non-standard.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines

## 3.0 Scope

This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.

## 4.0 Information Statement

The standards outlined here most often relate to the hardware and software products allocated to the operation of on-premises data centers, cloud computing, networking and individual end-users (desktops, notebooks, laptops, tablets, mobile devices, software, apps and related peripherals), typically fall into three (3) defining categories:

· Solutions Standards . Standards that specify the types of products that can be used (according to manufacturer, version, platform or other defining characteristics), as well as the process by which these standardized products are acquired.

· Utilization Standards . Standards that specify the applicability of a given technology product (or set of products) to a demonstrated, stated business need, forming the basis of technology planning, procurement, and product selection recommendations.

· Configuration Standards . Standards that specify the way selected devices, software and apps are installed and configured.

Standards encourage use of common platforms or approaches, streamline operational and sustainment activities, enable compliance and security and drive scale to maximize purchasing power. Adhering to technology standards will reduce support logistics and maintenance costs and increase availability by enabling system optimization. Standards may define or limit the tools, proprietary product offerings, or technology protocols which supported state entities may use, develop, or deploy.

ITS provides secure core information technology services that range from fundamental infrastructure services, such as compute, data storage, databases, backup, and networking services, to email, collaboration solutions, artificial intelligence, robotic process automation, application development, managed file transfer, identity management, telephony, and call center services

ITS has implemented IT portfolio management to govern the systematic management of IT investments, projects, and activities of the Information Technology departments. This process ensures alignment between agency business strategy and the technology

strategy for the State by ensuring technology solutions are developed in partnership with agencies and comply with all ITS standards.

ITS also evaluates current and emerging technologies to enable NYS government to meet demands, improve the performance of information systems and create efficiencies that improve the quality of the resident interactions with the State.

When identifying solutions, ITS considers the following in order of priority:

1) Use existing systems first and contribute to shared resources model.

2) Where ITS does not provide the technology or does not have a solution or does not have resources to support a technology, ITS will consider the following:

a) Procure the technology with support services and include knowledge transfer

b) Buy off-the-shelf (or open source) and change business processes to align.

c) Build custom applications.

ITS will evaluate the following factors when considering new or emerging technologies:

· Solutions must be part of the NYS technology strategy and meet the business needs and objectives of client agencies.

· Solutions must be efficient, as measured by operational spend.

· Solutions must be scalable, providing the ability to increase or decrease in performance and cost in response to changes in application and system processing demands.

Solutions must be highly available and allow for failover and/or redundancy.

Solutions must meet established technology standards.

· Solutions must meet security, privacy, compliance, and legal requirements.

· Solutions have adequate skilled support either provided by a third party or ITS staff.

· Solutions must be adequately tested and pass a security review.

ITS approves technology solutions through the engineering review process and/or the Plan to Procure (PTP) policy.

## 5.0 Compliance

This standard shall take effect upon publication and compliance is required. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

If compliance with this standard is not feasible, or if deviation from this standard is necessary to support a business function, then an exception may be requested through the technology exception process. Please see the Technology Exceptions Policy for more information.

## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms

Except for terms defined in this standard, all terms shall have the meanings found in its.ny.gov/glossary.
