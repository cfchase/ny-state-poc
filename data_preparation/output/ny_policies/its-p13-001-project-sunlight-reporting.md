## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The Public Integrity Reform Act of 2011 established Project Sunlight, an initiative which authorized the creation of an online database (http://www.projectsunlight.ny.gov/) that the public can access to see the names of individuals and entities interacting with government decision makers and imposes reporting requirements on certain state employees ("covered employees"). The purpose of this policy is to communicate the mandatory nature of the Project Sunlight training and reporting requirements to covered employees.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 1 of Executive Order No. 1171, issued January 2002, charges the State Chief Information Officer with overseeing and supervising the management and operations of the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS). Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.

## 3.0 Scope

This policy applies to employees of ITS.

The ITS Chief General Counsel will designate a list of employees covered by Project Sunlight. Those employees designated as covered employees will be notified of their access to mandatory training in the Statewide Learning Management System (SLMS) by the Division of Legal Affairs (DLA). From time to time, ITS employees may be designated or undesignated as their job responsibilities change. DLA will keep a list of all covered employees and update it at least twice a year.

Employees who believe they are covered by Project Sunlight should consult with DLA if they have not received notice they are covered. In such instances, employees should keep sufficient records of potential reportable contacts until they receive a determination from DLA.

## 4.0 Information Statement

$^{ }$4.1 This ITS policy is to ensure maximum compliance with all requirements of Project Sunlight.

Covered employees may designate a person to assist in entering information relating to covered "appearances" in the Project Sunlight database. Those persons should be reported to DLA so they may have access to the mandatory SLMS training and the reporting database. It remains the responsibility of the covered person to ensure that the appropriate information is being entered into the database.

4.2 The reporting requirements of Project Sunlight can be found at https://projectsunlight.ny.gov/Resources.aspx. More detailed guidance and training is available within SLMS or by contacting the Chief General Counsel or Division of Legal Affairs at projectsunlight@its.ny.gov. All appearances should be reported to the Project Sunlight database within 5 business days .

## 5.0 Compliance

This Policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all ITS policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.
