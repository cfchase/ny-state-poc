| IT Policy :  Accessibility of  Information  Communication  Technology | Updated: 08/19/2024  Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner:  Office of Digital Transformation |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

As government services become widely available online, making those online services accessible for all users is critical. This policy recognizes the importance of universal accessibility and establishes minimum accessibility requirements to ensure that Information and Communication Technology ("ICT"), including applications, websites, and other digital interfaces, developed, procured, maintained, or used by State Entities are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

This policy serves as ITS guidance required by State Technology Law (STL) Sections 103(20) and 103(21) regarding NYS Executive Law Section 170-f and STL Section 103D, respectively. These laws require state agencies and each contractor, subcontractor, vendor, consultant, or other person providing services pursuant to a state contract conform any website provided to the most current version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ("WCAG") adopted by the World Wide Web Consortium ("W3C") for accessibility, or any successor guidelines. The most current version of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines can be found here: https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/. Additionally, this policy also serves as guidance for compliance with the U.S. Department of Justice's rule on nondiscrimination on the basis of disability for the accessibility of web information and services (28 CFR Part 35, hereinafter "DOJ Rule").

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees of the SE and ITS, and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any Information Technology (IT) Resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy and a SE's policy, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.

## 4.0 Information Statement

This policy mandates adherence to the Level AA success criteria and conformance requirements as outlined in the WCAG Version 2.2, adopted by the W3C. Please note that there are important differences between the STL requirements and the DOJ Rule. SEs should consult with the legal counsel regarding the requirements of both.

## 4.1 DOJ Rule

In accordance with the DOJ Rule, SEs are to ensure that all web content and mobile applications, regardless of creation date unless specifically exempted, are accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities. The DOJ Rule requires compliance with WCAG Version 2.1, Level AA. The terms "web content" and "mobile applications" are defined in the rule.

## 4.1.1 Exceptions to the DOJ Rule

The DOJ Rule includes limited exceptions for web content and mobile application compliance with WCAG Version 2.1. The following is more fully described in the DOJ Rule available at 28 CFR Part 35:

· Archived web content;

· Content posted by a third party;

Preexisting conventional electronic documents unless those documents are used to apply for, gain access to, or participate in a public entity's services, programs, or activities;

Individualized, password-protected or otherwise secured conventional electronic documents; and

· Preexisting social media posts

## 4.2 STL Requirements

STL Section 103-d requires that newly launched state agency websites, as well as those undergoing significant "changes to form or function," conform to WCAG Version 2.2, Level AA, to the extent practicable.

STL Section 103-d defines "changes to form or function" as "…modifications to the visual presentation, informational organization, website infrastructure, or other user utility of the website, including but not limited to: 1. redesigns of the site layout, color schemes, graphics, branding elements, or other aesthetic components; and 2. integration of dynamic interfaces." Websites developed or managed through a thirdparty contract on behalf of an SE must also meet WCAG Version 2.2 AA conformance criteria. Detailed guidelines for achieving accessibility consistent with WCAG Version 2.2 AA are available on the W3C website at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/, which includes comprehensive support documentation under the section "WCAG 2.2 Supporting Documents."

## 4.2.1 Progress Reports

If a state agency cannot comply with STL Section 103-d by January 1, 2027, they are required to publicly post on their website a written progress report that describes, with specificity:

1) Actions the agency has taken to comply with STL Section 103-d;

3) Efforts the agency has made to overcome these obstacles; and

2) Obstacles that have hindered full compliance;

4) An estimated timeframe for achieving compliance.

This report must be updated annually following the initial publication.

## 4.3 Ensuring Compliance

To ensure compliance with the requirements of this policy, SEs must:

· Ensure that all web content and mobile applications conform to the Level AA success criteria and conformance requirements of WCAG Version 2.1 in accordance with the DOJ Rule by June 25, 2026.

o The most current version of WCAG Version 2.2, can be found here: https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/

· Ensure that each website either owned or maintained by the SE, including those provided by third parties, conform to the Level AA success criteria and conformance requirements of WCAG Version 2.2, or any successor guidelines, by January 1, 2027, in accordance with STL Section 103-d.

· Conduct manual testing of ICT before production use, prior to any fundamental alterations, and biennially thereafter through use of specialized software or services.

· Keep a list of ICTs and the current compliance status of each.

· Maintain documented testing reports for each ICT until the next automated and manual testing is completed.

Clearly display a link labeled "Accessibility" in the footer of the SE website's Home Page. The link should direct users to a page with contact information for questions about the site's accessibility and the accessibility of any other ICT under the control of the SE.

WCAG is backwards compatible meaning compliance with a later version ensures compliance with earlier versions, so agencies whose web content and mobile applications conform to WCAG Version 2.2 will comply with WCAG Version 2.1.

## 4.4 Website and Application Development by Third Parties

All solicitation documents, contracts, and any amendments executed by SEs containing a scope of work requiring development, procurement, and/or maintenance of ICT shall include the following clause:

Any network-based information and applications development, or programming, including, but not limited to, websites delivered to or by the State pursuant to this contract or procurement, will comply with Section 130-d of the State Technology Law, as amended, Executive Law Section 170-f, as amended, and be consistent with New York State Enterprise IT Policy NYS-P08-005, Accessibility of Information Communication Technology, as such policy may be amended, modified or superseded (the "Accessibility Policy"). The Accessibility Policy requires that State Entity Information Communication Technology shall be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities as determined by accessibility compliance testing. Such accessibility compliance testing will be conducted by [State Entity name, contractor or other] and any report on the results of such testing must be satisfactory to [State Entity name].

## 4.5 Third-Party Procured Software

During software procurement of any pre-built software with a user-interface (either web-based or operating-system level software), the vendor should supply or complete for review a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) as attestation of the

software's level of accessibility. VPAT details can be found at https://www.section508.gov/sell/vpat/

## 5.0 Compliance

This policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms

Except for terms defined in this policy, all terms shall have the meanings found in http://www.its.ny.gov/glossary.
