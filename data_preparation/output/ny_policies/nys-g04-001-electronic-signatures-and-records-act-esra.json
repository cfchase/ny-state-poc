The e-signature method selected will partially determine the approaches needed to ensure the trustworthiness of the e-signed e-record over time.

As with any e-record, acceptance of signed e-records for legal, audit, and other purposes depends on demonstrating the trustworthiness of the system used to produce them, and, maintaining the ability to revalidate e-signatures is only available where the esignature method relies primarily on a digital object that can be revalidated (e.g., an encrypted hash, a digitized signature, or a biometric). Retaining all records of the system's functionality specific to a particular e-signature technology or approach is needed for the revalidation process to be successful. For digital signatures produced with PKI, ensure the PKI is governed by a certificate policy addressing all aspects of a digital certificate's generation, management, use, and storage as well as the roles and responsibilities of all entities involved in the PKI.
