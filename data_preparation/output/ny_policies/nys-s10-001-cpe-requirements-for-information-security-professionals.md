| Continuing Professional  Education Requirements  for Information Security  Professionals | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner:  Chief Information Security Office |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The purpose of this standard is to outline the minimum requirements for Continuing Professional Education (CPE) for members of the workforce who are serving in an information security role (e.g., information security officer (ISO), cyber risk coordinator (CRC), information security analyst (ISA), cyber incident responder, cyber intelligenc e analyst, etc.) for a State Entity (SE).

The requirement of CPE credits helps assure that these individuals stay current in this rapidly evolving field and maintain their breadth of knowledge.

## $^{ }$2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Officeof Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards

NYS-S10-001

for State government, including hardware, software, security and business reengineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any Information Technology (IT) Resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this standard and an SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive requirement will take precedence.

This standard applies to members of the State workforce who have been designated as having information security responsibilities for an SE. This includes those within an information security business unit who fulfill the functional responsibilities of an ISO as outlined in the NYS-P03-002: Information Security Policy, and is not intended to include support staff.

## 4.0 Information Statement

Due to the dynamic nature of information technology and the need to maintain an adequate level of current knowledge and proficiency in information security, a minimum of thirtyseven and one half (37.5) hours of CPE credits must be completed annually. The CPEs must be directly related to information systems security. The SE will provide the opportunity for information security professionals to earn the required CPEs annually.

Criteria for qualifying the activities for CPE credits will be based on Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) and International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium (ISC2) guidelines. In cases where there is a discrepancy between these guidelines, the lesser requirements apply.

The annual time period to earn CPE credits will coincide with the calendar year (January 1 to December 31). An individual's cycle will begin the January following appointment to the information security role. Credits must be earned during the current year to qualify and may not be carried forward or backward from year to year.

Approved information systems security categories include but are not limited to:

· Access control

· Telecommunications and network security

· Information security governance and risk management practices

· Software development security

· Cryptography

· Security architecture and design

· Operations security

· Business continuity and disaster recovery

· Law, regulations, compliance, and investigation

· Physical (environmental) security

CPE credits are given for related experience outside of normal on-the-job duties. For instance, while time spent independently preparing an information security presentation for a community organization would qualify for CPE credits, an equivalent amount of time spent on the job preparing a staff presentation, other internal publications or events would NOT qualify.

CPE credits are weighted by activity. Below are common categories of activities and the number of credits earned for each. These activities are not intended to be a complete listing, as many other events such as graduate work in an appropriate academic field, may also qualify. Typically, you will earn 1 CPE credit for each hour spent engaged in an educational activity. However, some activities are worth more CPEs, due to the depth of study or ongoing commitment involved. CPE activities include but are not limited to:

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a security educational training course or seminar.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a security conference. The New York State (NYS) Cyber Security Conference qualifies for CPE credits.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a State information security community of practice meeting (IS-CoP) or NYS Forum information security workgroup meeting.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a professional security association chapter meeting, such as the ISC2, Information Systems Security Association (ISSA), ISACA, etc.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at a higher education course within the scope of information security domains. A maximum of 40 CPEs may be earned per course. Credit will only be given on passing the course successfully.

· Earn CPE credits for preparing courseware, lectures, or training material. The time spent preparing for and delivering each hour of presentation material is valued at 4 CPE credits (e.g., a one-hour presentation = 4 CPEs, a two-hour presentation = 8 CPEs). The 4 CPEs for each hour of presentation will only be granted for the initial course, lecture, or training presentation, thereafter you will receive 1 CPE for each hour of presentation.

· Earn CPE credits for contributing original work to the information systems security profession. First publication of a security related article will earn the author(s) 10 CPE credits. Publication of a security related book will earn 40 CPE credits.

· Earn up to 12 CPE credits per year, 1 for each month of service on the board of professional security organization, such as ISC2, ISSA, ISACA, etc.

· Earn 1 CPE for each month of active participation on a State or national information security workgroup or committee.

· Earn 1 CPE credit for each hour of attendance at security webcasts.

· Credits can be earned by completing a self-study program or completing computerbased training. The course provider issues a certificate of completion and supplies the number of CPE hours earned for the course. Study material and validated documentation of completion, such as a certificate or diploma, must be retained.

· Reading an information security text will be worth 2 CPE credits. Credit in this category will be limited to one text per year. If audited, the individual should retain proof of possession, such as the actual book, a sales receipt, invoice, library record, etc.

· Completion and submission of an original information security book review will be worth 3 CPE credits (limited to one text per year).

· Earn 1 CPE for each hour of attendance at a vendor security product training class or an information security specific sales presentation. Credits for a security sales presentation will be limited to 3 per year.
