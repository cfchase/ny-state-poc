## 4.0 Information Statement

An ITS POV is a formal evaluation of an un-procured technology to demonstrate that the technology has practical potential to fill a business need. The objective of a POV is

to explore and demonstrate the potential of a Product or Service to solve or transform a business problem. It is not intended to provide a Production Ready environment, but instead provides a collaborative exercise to illustrate the capabilities and identify potential risks or implementation considerations.

Prior to conducting a POV, a formal documented approval must be obtained. Only ITS authorized signatories may execute any legal documentation that include any on-line click-through agreements.

To request a POV review and approval, please have your portfolio architect initiate an ITSM Engineering Consultation request. A POV may not begin until all appropriate approvals are received.

POV results must be documented using a standard template.
