| IT Policy :          | Updated:  11/23/2021                                       |
| Information Security | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This policy defines the mandatory minimum information security requirements for all State Entities (SEs) as defined below in Section 3.0 Scope. Any SE may, based on its individual business needs and specific legal and federal requirements, exceed the security requirements put forth in this policy, but must, at a minimum, achieve the security levels required by this policy.

This policy acts as an umbrella document to all other Office of Information Technology Services' (ITS) security policies and associated standards. This policy defines the responsibility of all SEs to:

· protect and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and related infrastructure assets;

· manage the risk of security exposure or compromise;

· ensure a secure and stable information technology (IT) environment;

· identify and respond to events involving information asset misuse, loss, or unauthorized disclosure;

· monitor systems for anomalies that might indicate compromise; and

· promote and increase the awareness of information security.

Failure to secure and protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets in today's highly networked environment can damage or shut down systems that operate critical infrastructure, financial and business transactions, and vital government functions; compromise data; and result in legal and regulatory non-compliance.

This policy benefits SEs by defining a framework that will ensure appropriate measures are in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of New York State (NYS) information; and ensure staff and all other affiliates understand their role and responsibilities, have adequate knowledge of security policy, procedures, and practices, and know how to protect SE information.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy , NYS-P08-002, Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This policy applies to all SEs, defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117 1 , issued January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law including their employees, and all third parties (e.g., local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors), that use or access any IT resource for which the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

This policy encompasses all systems, automated and manual, for which New York State has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE. It addresses all information, regardless of the form or format, which is created or used in support of business activities of SEs.

## 4.0 Information Statement

## 4.1 Organizational Security

a. Information security requires both an information risk management function (including cyber-related risk management) and an information technology security function. Depending on the structure of the SE, an individual or group can serve in both roles or a separate individual or group can be designated for each role. It is

recommended that these functions be performed by a high-level executive or a group that includes high level executives.

1. Each SE must designate an individual or group to be responsible for the risk management function. For the purposes of clarity and readability, this policy will refer to the individual, or group, so designated as the Cyber Risk Coordinator (CRC) ( see Exhibit 1 for a more detailed description of the role). The CRC is responsible for ensuring that:

i. risk-related considerations for information assets and individual information systems, including authorization decisions, are viewed from the perspective of the SE as an enterprise regarding the overall strategic goals and objectives of the SE in carrying out its core missions and business functions; and

ii. the management of information assets, information system-related security risks, and other cyber-security risks is consistent across the SE, reflects the risk tolerance of the SE, and is considered along with other types of risks to ensure mission/business success.

2. Each SE must designate an individual or group to be responsible for the technical information security function. For purposes of clarity and readability, this policy will refer to the individual, or group, designated as the Information Security Officer (ISO)/designated security representative. This function will be responsible for evaluating and advising on information security risks. For SEs that receive IT services as a member of one of the portfolios within ITS, the information security function may be fulfilled by the Chief Information Security Office (CISO) and Security Services Teams.

b. Information security risk decisions must be made through consultation with both function areas described in a. above.

c. Although the technical information security function may be outsourced to third parties, each SE retains overall responsibility for the security of the information that it owns. The function of the CRC must be performed within the SE.

f. If the SE is unable to determine the confidentiality classification of information then it must have a high confidentiality classification and, therefore, is subject to high confidentiality controls.

g. Merging of information which creates a new information asset or situations that create the potential for merging (e.g., backup tape with multiple files) must be evaluated to determine if a new classification of the merged data is warranted.

h. All reproductions of information in its entirety must carry the same confidentiality classification as the original. Partial reproductions need to be evaluated to determine if a new classification is warranted.

i. Each classification has an approved set of baseline controls designed to protect the data asset and is aligned with NIST 800-53B Control Baselines for Information

Systems and Organizations. These controls must be evaluated, tailored, and implemented to meet business requirements.

j. The SE must communicate the requirements for secure handling of information to its workforce.

k. A written or electronic inventory of all SE information assets must be maintained by the SE.

Associated Standards: NYS-S14-002, Information Classification Standard; NYS-S13003, Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard;

## 4.6 Information Sharing

a. SE content made available to the general public must be reviewed according to a process to be defined and approved by the SE. The process must include the review and approval of updates to publicly available content and must consider the type and classification of information posted.

b. PPSI must not be made available without appropriate safeguards approved by the SE.

## Exhibit 1

## Cyber Risk Coordinator Description

As outlined in Section 4.1., SEs must designate an individual or group to be responsible for cyber-related risk management. The Cyber Risk Coordinator (CRC) is the SE-assigned individual who ensures that cyber-related risk is managed within an SE. Organizations can implement this role either as a function of a current role (e.g., counsel, internal controls, etc.), or by creating a new role. The CRC must understand the SE's strategic goals and objectives. This individual should be either authorized to or made able to facilitate riskbased decision making, working with executive leadership. Where cyber security is a shared responsibility between SEs and ITS, the SE is responsible for managing security requirements and risk, by performing and/or participating in the following functions:

· Identification of critical assets

· Account management and control of agency resources

Data classification

Incident response and management

Developing requirements for systems that support business functions

· Employee awareness and training

· Preparation and review of agency policies and procedures

· Routine assessments where the SE must play a lead role (e.g., annual Nationwide Cyber Security Review)

Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity planning
