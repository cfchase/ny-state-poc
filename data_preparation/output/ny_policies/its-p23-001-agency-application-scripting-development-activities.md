| Agency Application &  Scripting Development  Activities | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner:  Chief Technology Office |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

This policy defines the scenarios when application and scripting development activities may be performed by ITS Client Agency program staff. This policy also defines the acceptable use of Client Agency Development Platforms.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, interns, and ITS

supported agencies ("Client Agency"). This policy applies to any application or scripting development activities that are managed outside of the ITS intake process. Activities relating to data analytics, such as generating reports, are not considered Client Agency application or scripting development activities. Therefore, these activities are not in the scope of this policy.

## 4.0 Information Statement

## Appropriate Use of Agency Development

2. In addition to the application user base, Client Agencies cannot develop applications when any of the following criteria apply:

1. Client Agencies may develop or create their own business applications when the target user base is an individual or a single business unit. Applications with a user scope of entire departments or inter-department processes must be built and maintained by ITS or procured through a third-party following appropriate procurement protocol including NYS-P08-001 - Plan to Procure .

a. Business processes are being implemented beyond personal or workgroup productivity.

c. The application requires the use of a privileged account.

b. The use case requires a new data integration from an existing ITS managed system.

d. The data persisted or transmitted by the application has a data confidentiality, integrity, or availability (CIA) impact of Moderate or High.

f. There are some platforms where these prohibitive criteria do not apply. See Section 4.4 for more details.

e. The application exposes or ingests information to or from external users.

## 4.1 Applicability of Information Security Requirements

All applications and components created or developed independently by a ClientAgency are subject to all NYS Information Security policies and standards. Client Agencies must consult with their assigned information security representative in the ITS Chief Information Security Office prior to developing each application to ensure the appropriate security requirements have been addressed.

## 4.2 Agency Development Support

ITS is responsible for maintaining the operation of platforms that enable Client Agency application development activities. Client agency development is only permitted on ITS supported platforms. The Client Agency is solely responsible for any applications or components created through their own development efforts. ITS will not support applications developed by non-ITS personnel unless the intellectual property of the application is transferred to ITS, and the application is completely onboarded through the ITS Demand process.

## 4.3 Application Inventory and Monitoring

Platforms that are authorized for Client Agency development must support producing an application inventory or a comprehensive usage report. Where applicable, application metadata (such as application descriptions) must be provided by the Client

Agency. Inactive applications that have not been used in over 365 days may be decommissioned by ITS. Client Agency developers will be notified within 10 business days before an inactive application is decommissioned. If the client agency identifies a legal preservation obligation tied to an application, it is the responsibility of the client agency to engage its legal counsel and ITS Enterprise eDiscovery Services for appropriate preservation action.

## 4.4 Authorized Agency Development Platforms

Only the NYS Chief Technology Officer, or their designee, may authorize a platform for client agency development. A list of authorized client agency development platforms can be found on this KB article. Each platform may have specific criteria for acceptable use. These criteria may override any section in this policy.

## 5.0 Compliance

This policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms

Except for terms defined in this policy, all terms shall have the meanings found in http://www.its.ny.gov/glossary .
