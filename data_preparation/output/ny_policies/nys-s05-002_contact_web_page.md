## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The purpose of this mandatory technology standard is to ensure that each state government entity web site has a standard contact webpage that easily and separately identifies contact information for the public and can be linked to from the State Portal.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business reengineering.

governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors), that use or access any ITS Information Technology Resource for which ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of ITS. While an SE may adopt a different standard, such standard must meet the requirements of this standard.
