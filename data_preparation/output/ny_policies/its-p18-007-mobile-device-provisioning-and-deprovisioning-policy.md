| ITS Policy :  Mobile Device  Provisioning,  Deprovisioning, and  Replacement | Updated:  12/22/2020  Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner:  Chief Technology Office   Workplace Services |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The rapid growth and availability of mobile technology solutions makes it possible to perform official business outside the constraints of the traditional office setting. Mobile technology enables users to not only send and receive voice calls, email, and text messages, but also allows them to access business data and applications from anywhere at any time. Users whose job responsibilities frequently take them away from the office can take full advantage of mobile technology solutions to conduct State business, communicate effectively, and securely access New York State ("NYS" or "State") data when required.

This mobile device policy ("Policy"), issued by the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS), sets forth mobile device provisioning and deprovisioning processes; defines standard vs non-standard mobile devices, including accessories; sets forth the billing process for device counts in excess of the established baseline; and establishes a mobile device repair/replacement policy for a device that is inoperable, lost or stolen.

ITS strives to provide a high quality, sustainable, secure, and cost-effective mobile experience through issuing mobile standards and normalized rate plans. ITS mobile service rates can be found at https://its.ny.gov/service-rates. Additionally, this Policy will ensure the State's mobile technology assets are deployed appropriately and consistently. 1

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 2 provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYSP08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, interns, and ITS supported agencies ("Client Agency").

## 4.0 Information Statement

Effective as of the date of this policy, ITS, in conjunction with the NYS Division of Budget ("DOB") and the Office of State Operations, will manage the State's mobile technology spending and provisioning in accordance with the guidelines established herein. The intent of this Policy is to provide ITS' Client Agencies access to the mobile devices and services necessary to keep up with current technology trends, support user needs and Client Agency missions, and ensure the appropriate use and efficacy of State resources.

A baseline for the number of mobile devices by type provisioned to each Client Agency will be set based on carrier records as of March 31, 2020. Going forward, any devices added that exceed that device type's baseline will be addressed via direct bill on a monthly basis. Requests for additional devices must be submitted to ITS through the Enterprise IT Service Management System (ITSM) service catalog.

## Mobile Device Provisioning and Technology Management

Users deemed by their agency to require the use of State-issued mobile devices to perform their job duties pursuant to an approved Mobile Device Plan will be provided the necessary devices, in accordance with the Best Practices set forth in Appendix B of this Policy. Issuance of any mobile device must be in accordance with the Client Agency's approved Mobile Device Plan. ITS recommends that Client Agency users are limited to a maximum of one data plan per user. The Client Agency's Mobile Device Plan must justify all exceptions to this limitation for each individual user. It is the

responsibility of the Client Agency to properly onboard users for mobile device usage by completing and submitting either an Employee Onboarding request or Mobile Device request through the ITSM Service Catalog. ITS Workplace Services (WPS) will then fulfill the request in accordance with this Policy.

## Biannual Mobile Usage Report

To aid in management of mobile technology usage, ITS will provide Client Agencies with biannual reports identifying all the agency's mobile devices by device type with assigned user and device activity levels. Timing of biannual reports will coincide with the ITS quarterly billing cycle and invoices.

ITS will also include recommendations in these biannual reports for changes to existing or future mobile technology deployments within the Client Agency to ensure the appropriate use of State resources. For example, ITS may recommend conversion of smartphone devices with no data usage to voice-only devices, elimination of inactive lines with no voice or data usage or tethering of devices. These biannual reports will also identify users with more than one data plan for examination by the agency.

The Client Agency must either accept or reject (with explanation) the recommendations in a biannual report within 30 calendar days of issuance. This response should be provided to the ITS Mobile Device Team at its.sm.enterprisemobility@its.ny.gov. Failure to respond to a biannual report within 30 calendar days of issuance constitutes acceptance of the report by the Client Agency, including acceptance of any resulting action taken by ITS consistent with this policy.

## Client Agency Mobile Device Plan

Within 90 calendar days of the original issuance of this Policy, Client Agencies shall develop and submit a Mobile Device Plan to ITS authorizing the usage of mobile devices. The Commissioner or Executive Deputy Commissioner must certify the plan. The Mobile Device Plan shall identify Client Agency users who are eligible for mobile devices. Such plan must be submitted to ITS at ITSBilling@its.ny.gov . As changes to the agency's Mobile Device Plan are made, recertified plans must be submitted to ITS.

Appended hereto are a list of best practices agencies should consider when drafting such plan (see Appendix B). Client agencies shall work with ITS to determine how to adequately fulfill mobile technology needs in the most efficient and cost-effective manner available in accordance with the approved Mobile Device Plan and this Policy. An example Mobile Device Plan is provided in Appendix C.

At ITS' discretion, inoperable standard mobile devices will be repaired or replaced with new or repurposed like devices. Lost or stolen standard mobile devices will be replaced with new or repurposed like devices.

## Deprovisioning Mobile Devices

ITS is responsible for maintaining an accurate inventory of available and allocated mobile devices. This inventory enables ITS to provide the necessary mobile devices to Client Agencies - ensuring that agency users have the tools they need to properly serve the citizens and businesses of New York State.

It is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly offboard its user upon separation from the agency or return devices no longer needed to include coordination with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before proceeding with deprovisioning requests to ITS. Whether the user leaves state service or simply transfers to a new agency, the Client Agency must promptly complete and submit an Employee Offboarding request through the ITSM Service Catalog which provides ITS WPS the necessary information to reclaim and re-allocate the mobile device. For devices no longer needed, the Client Agency must promptly complete and submit a Return a Mobile

Device request through the ITSM Service Catalog and ship the device to the address provided in ITSM.

Before a Client Agency submits a request to offboard a user, it should first consult with the Chief Legal Officer of the Client Agency to ensure all legal preservation obligations are met. Devices no longer in use by a Client Agency should be returned to ITS, unless directed otherwise by the Chief Legal Officer of the Client Agency due to legal preservation obligations.

Additionally, mobile device users are not permitted to transfer their mobile device, the phone number or data plan associated with that device, to a personal account or between state agencies at any time. Any exceptions to this prohibition require authorization and request to ITS from the Chief Legal Officer of the Client Agency.

## APPENDIX B : MOBILE DEVICE PLAN BEST PRACTICES

## Introduction:

For the purposes of this policy, mobile devices shall include cell phones, smartphones, aircard/MiFi devices, and tablets. A Mobile Device Plan should include the user's name, e-mail address, and justification of need. The following best practices and device options are designed to assist Client Agency officials in making decisions pertaining to the assignment of mobile devices to users.

## Best Practices:

The following are categories where the use of a mobile device may be considered. Users may fall within none, one, or more of these categories.

· Mobile Users Mobile devices may be required for users who:

o Are required to work in three or more physical locations in a given 30-day period;

o Spend a large portion of their daily work activities (20% or more) in a mobile non-fixed, and/or travel capacity;

o Have employment responsibilities that require systematic capture of information via data input, sensors, cameras, or other electronic means; and/or

o Are assigned to duty stations where issuance of fixed telephone or network connections are impractical for cost, reliability, or other reasons.

· On-call Users Mobile devices may be required for users who:

o Routinely use, review, or produce sensitive data that may also be subject to compliance rules and regulations that require additional technology controls that cannot be accommodated by non-State-issued communications equipment.

o Are expected and required to be on-call and to perform their job duties outside of regular business hours; and/or

· Emergency Equipment Mobile devices may be required for users who:

Have a role in emergency response; and/or

o Are expected to communicate during emergencies;

o Have employment responsibilities that require ready access to geographic location data.

## Device Options:

If it is determined that it is necessary for a user to have a mobile device to perform their daily employment responsibilities, the following are recommended use cases:

· A cell phone should be considered in cases where a user only needs to make/receive voice calls and/or send/receive text messages, and no alternative communication method is available.

· A smartphone should be considered in cases where a user needs to make/receive voice calls as well as access the Internet, use e-mail, and/or exchange written, or graphic information and Wi-Fi is not available.

· A tablet should be considered in instances where users need to access the Internet, e-mail or other applications, and/or exchange written or graphic information, but do not need to make/receive voice calls. Tablets can be Wi-Fi-only or include a data plan. If a data plan is needed, the user should not also have a smartphone. A tablet is not needed when the user has a laptop.

· An aircard/MiFi should be considered in instances where a user needs to access the Internet, e-mail or other applications, but already possess a laptop or tablet device that is Wi-Fi-only.

## APPENDIX C : EXAMPLE MOBILE DEVICE PLAN

Summary: This document outlines the Agency's plan for mobile device usage and assignment of mobile devices, as required by ITS-P18-007 Mobile Device Provisioning, Deprovisioning, and Replacement policy. This plan should be regularly maintained and re-certified to reflect any changes in Agency mobile device needs.

Mobile Device Provisioning Guidelines: The following user roles are approved for mobile devices:

· Mobile workforce - Users of Unit A are in travel status approximately 40% of the time. To perform their job duties effectively, they are expected to regularly respond to e-mail communications, even when in travel status.

· On-call workforce - Users of Unit B are required to be reachable via phone call during off-hours.

o Approved device type: smartphone

o Approved device type: cell phone

o Approved device type: MiFi

· Emergency response team - Users of Unit C are part of an emergency response team, and often need to perform work in a location different from their normal workstation. Given that data connectivity may not be readily available, a portable data connection is needed.

· Emergency vehicles - Unit D has a fleet of vehicles that are used to perform everyday business functions. The users working in unit D do not have their own individual State-issued cell phones.

o Approved device type: cell phone to be left in vehicle

Exceptions to One Data Plan Limitation: Per ITS-P18-007, the Agency will not authorize more than one data plan per user. The following is a list of users that have more than one data plan, and associated justification that describes the reason why the direction per ITS P18-007 cannot be followed:

Approvals for Mobile Devices: Per ITS-P18-007, the Agency is responsible for ensuring that the business and financial approval of all Agency mobile devices is in accordance with this Plan.
