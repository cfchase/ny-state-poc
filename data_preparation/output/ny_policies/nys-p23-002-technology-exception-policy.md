| New York State Information Technology Policy               | No:  NYS-P23-002      |
|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Issued: 09/28/2023                                         | IT Policy :           |
| Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services | Technology Exceptions |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The purpose of this policy is to establish a method for obtaining an exception from an information technology policy, standard, or solution that is issued or provided by the New York State (NYS) Office of Information Technology Services' (ITS) Chief Technology Office (CTO).

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines.

## 3.0 Scope

This policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities as defined in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy/standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy/standard, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.

## 4.0 Information Statement

An exception is required prior to implementing or deploying a technology solution that deviates from a technology policy, standard, or solution issued or provided by ITS. Additionally, certain technology standards may also be enforced through automated processes implemented through ITS's Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) system.

Technology exceptions may be granted by the ITS Chief Information Officer (CIO), or their designee, where compliance with a technology policy or standard is not feasible, or to deviate from utilizing an established enterprise technology service or an established technology solution when applicable to a required use case. Justification for technology exceptions is limited to:

· Impending retirement of a system.

· The total cost of ownership of the established service or solution exceeds the total cost of ownership of the proposed alternative.

Infeasibility to implement the policy, standard, or solution due to some limitation.

· There is an elevated risk with the established service or solution based on the business context.

Exceptions are reviewed on a case-by-case basis and their approval is not automatic. Exceptions that are granted will be for a specific period of time. Upon expiration of the exception, an extension of the exception may be requested, if it is still required.

The exception request must be submitted on a completed Exception Request Form and must include:

· The description of the non-compliance or deviation

· The proposed assessment of risk associated with non-compliance

The anticipated time-period of non-compliance or deviation

A cost benefit analysis between the standard approach and the proposed alternative

· A proposed review date to evaluate progress toward compliance

The Exception Request Form must be agreed to by the ITS CIO, or their designee, and the requesting agency's Commissioner or an Executive Deputy Commissioner, or equivalent level decision maker. Technology exceptions may be referred to the ITS Chief Information Security Office (CISO) if there are information security implications. The requesting agency will receive a written response from ITS as to whether an exception is being granted or denied and the reasons thereof, or a request for additional information, within ten business days.

## 5.0 Compliance

This policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms

Except for terms defined in this policy, all terms shall have the meanings found in its.ny.gov/glossary.
