## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

Domestic violence and other forms of gender-based violence permeate the lives and harm thousands of New Yorkers each day, with tragic, destructive, and often fatal results. The impacts of such violence are felt in the workplace, regardless of where the incidents are taking place, and have the potential to compromise the safety of victims, co-workers, and clients, while resulting in lost productivity, increased health care costs, absenteeism, and employee turnover. Employers have both a moral and legal obligation to their employees who may be experiencing victimization.

New York State law recognizes that domestic and gender-based violence occurs within a wide spectrum of relationships, therefore ITS will take every appropriate measure to prevent and/or address domestic and gender-based violence as it impacts the workplace, while also recognizing the rights of victims to have self-determination and the need to respond in a survivor-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive manner. All valid orders of protection shall be enforced by ITS and all protections of this policy shall apply. This policy shall apply to all victims of gender-based violence, regardless of where the incidents took place.

ITS, to the fullest extent possible, without violating any existing rules, regulations, statutory requirements, contractual obligations, or collective bargaining agreements, designates and directs appropriate management, supervisory, and/or human resources staff to implement the following Gender-Based Violence and the Workplace Policy.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 1 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , issued January 2002, charges the State Chief Information Officer with overseeing and supervising the management and operations of ITS . Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in New York State (NYS) ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

Sections 3 and 4 of Executive Order No.17 , issued April 28, 2022, charges state agencies to formulate and issue a Gender-based Violence and the Workplace policy (Policy) no later than January 1, 2023.

## 4.3 Non-discrimination and Responsive Personnel Policies

All ITS policies and procedures should be trauma-informed, survivor-centered, and culturally responsive to victims' needs, and should not discriminate. Under the New York State Human Rights Law, all persons covered by this policy are protected from discrimination in the workplace on the basis of status as a victim of domestic violence and on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. The following is a list of some relevant laws on this topic, as well as additional guidance on personnel policies:

1. Subdivision 34 of section 292 of the Executive Law of New York State establishes persons who qualify as a "victim of domestic violence."

a. Employers may not refuse to hire or license and may not terminate someone solely based on their status as a victim of domestic violence.

2. Victims of domestic violence are a protected class under New York State Human Rights Law (Executive Law § 296(22)).

b. Employers may not discriminate against victims of domestic violence in compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment.

3. Employers must allow any employee who has disclosed their status as a victim of domestic or gender-based violence (or disclosed that a family member is a victim of domestic or gender-based violence) and must be out of work for a reasonable time to use accrued sick leave1 for the following purposes:

c. Employers must prohibit inquiries about an applicant's status as a current or past victim of domestic violence and may not make any employment decisions based on assumptions or actual knowledge about someone's status as a current or past victim of domestic violence. Employers may inquire about status as a victim of domestic violence in order to provide reasonable accommodations.

a. to obtain services from a domestic violence shelter, rape crisis center, or other services program;

c. to meet with an attorney or other social services provider to obtain information and advice on, and prepare for or participate in any criminal or civil proceeding;

b. to participate in safety planning, temporarily or permanently relocate, or take other actions to increase the safety of the employee or employee's family members;

d. to file a complaint or domestic incident report with law enforcement;

f. to enroll children in a new school;

g. to address issues relating to technology or financial abuse; or

4. Employees can choose to use appropriate leave accruals to cover any absences, if available. If the employee does not have adequate leave accruals to cover the

h. to take any other actions necessary to ensure the health or safety of the employee or the employee's family member or to protect those who associate or work with the employee.

absence or chooses not to charge leave accruals, the absence shall be treated as leave without pay.

6. Employees who must be absent to utilize accommodations as listed in this section shall provide their employer with reasonable advanced notice of the absence whenever possible

5. Any employee who must be absent from work to utilize accommodations in this section is entitled to the continuation of any health insurance coverage provided by the employer to which the employee is otherwise entitled during any such absence, in accordance with any existing collective bargaining agreements, regulations, and policy.

7. Employers are also required to grant time off, with prior day notification, and may not penalize any employee who, as a victim or witness of a criminal offense, is appearing as a witness; consulting with a district attorney; or exercising their rights as provided by law. 2 Employees can choose to use appropriate leave accruals to cover any absences, if available. If the employee does not have adequate leave accruals to cover the absence or chooses not to charge leave accruals, the absence shall be treated as leave without pay. Any questions regarding leave that must be granted to victims or subpoenaed witnesses should be directed to ITS' personnel office or the Attendance and Leave Unit at the Department of Civil Service.

9. Employees who are victims of domestic violence or gender-based violence who separate from a covered family member due to an incident or incidents of domestic or gender-based violence shall be allowed to make reasonable changes in benefits at any time during the calendar year, where possible and in accordance with statute, regulation, contract, and policy.

8. Employers should be aware that there may be occurrences when an employee is absent due to incidents of domestic or gender-based violence where they are unable to follow ITS protocol to report the absence. In that situation, the employee may lack documentation, may be unable to obtain documentation or may not want to share documentation containing confidential information. An employer may not require the disclosure of confidential information relating to an absence from work due to domestic violence, a sexual offense, stalking, or human trafficking, as a condition of providing sick leave.

10. ITS recognizes that victims of domestic and gender-based violence may experience temporary work performance difficulties or be unable to complete certain job aspects because of safety reasons. (Examples include overnight travel, "off" hour shifts, etc.) If it is found that the employee's work performance is being affected as a result of being a victim of domestic or gender-based violence, ITS will work with the employee to try to create a satisfactory resolution, including, but not limited to, specific work plans, the ability to take leave, provision of reasonable accommodations, referrals to the DVAL, EAP, and/or the local domestic violence service provider. OPDV is available for case specific technical assistance as needed. Employees will be given clear information of performance expectations, priorities, and performance evaluations. Employees should be made aware that not all employees requests for resolutions can be accommodated. If a disciplinary process is initiated, special care should be taken

to consider all aspects of the victimized employee's situation, and all available options in trying to resolve the performance problems should be exhausted, including making a referral to the DVAL, EAP, domestic violence program or other relevant services, consistent with existing collective bargaining unit agreements, statute, regulations, and ITS policy.

12. New York State law prohibits insurance companies and health maintenance organizations from discriminating against domestic violence victims by prohibiting status as a domestic violence victim to be considered a "pre-existing condition." Insurance companies may not deny or cancel an insurance policy or require a higher premium or payment because the insured party is a current or former victim of domestic violence. 4

11. If all reasonable measures have been exhausted to resolve related performance problems of employees who are victims of domestic or gender-based violence, but the performance problems persist and the employee is terminated or voluntarily separates from employment, the employee shall be informed of their potential eligibility for unemployment insurance and ITS shall respond quickly to any requests for information that may be needed in the claims process. New York State law provides that a victim of domestic violence who voluntarily separates from employment may, under certain circumstances, be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. 3

13. Sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression are all protected classes under the New York State Human Rights Law. Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is unlawful under the New York State Human Rights Law § 296.1, Human Rights Law § 296-c (for interns), and Human Rights Law § 296-d (for non-employees working in the workplace), and Title VII, the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. Sexual harassment includes harassment based on sex, sexual orientation, self-identified or perceived sex, gender expression, gender identity and the status of being transgender (see page 2-3 for definition of sexual harassment). Gender-based violence may constitute sexual harassment when it subjects an individual to inferior terms, conditions, or privileges of employment

15. For all forms of discrimination and harassment, if an employee, including an intern or contractor working in a State workplace, experiences sexual harassment or discrimination on the basis of their status as a victim of domestic or other gender-based violence, or observes discrimination in the workplace, the employee may file a complaint to OER via the New York State Employee Discrimination Complaint form located at www.oer.ny.gov, or by contacting an equal employment officer.

14. Every employer in New York State must have a policy on sexual harassment prevention, which includes a procedure for the receipt and investigation of complaints of sexual harassment. This policy and procedure should be distributed to new employees and made available to all staff regularly. ITS's sexual harassment and discrimination policy is the New York State Equal Employment Opportunity Handbook which may be found at EEO handbook here:https://oer.ny.gov/equal-employment-opportunity-rights-andresponsibilities-handbook-employees-new-york-state-agencies

16. Any complaint of potential discrimination, whether verbal or written, must be investigated by OER. Furthermore, any supervisory or managerial employee who observes or otherwise becomes aware of conduct of a sexually harassing nature must report such conduct to OER so that it can be investigated. The confidentiality of the complainant shall be maintained to the extent practical.

## 4.4 Non-Retaliation Policy

ITS shall not engage in any retaliatory practices against any employee that discloses they are a victim of domestic or gender-based violence, or any employee seeking accommodations or to exercise their rights under this policy.

ITS will not retaliate, tolerate retaliation by any superiors, terminate, or discipline any employees for reporting information about alleged incidents of domestic violence that may have been committed by an employee, including those in management positions.

Retaliatory practices may include, but are not limited to, fewer promotions, inappropriate jokes, snide comments, excluding employee from conversations, etc., and may be carried out by everyone, not just the original perpetrator. Retaliation includes commencing discipline against victimized employees for actions taken to promote their safety.

Any employee or agency engaging in retaliatory practices may be subject to disciplinary actions. If you believe you have been subject to retaliatory practices, please see Section 4.9: Violations of Policy .

## 4.5 Workplace safety plans

All ITS policies and procedures should be trauma-informed, survivor-centered, and culturally responsive to victims' needs, and should not discriminate. Under the New York State Human Rights Law, all persons covered by this policy are protected from discrimination in the workplace on the basis of status as a victim of domestic violence and on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
