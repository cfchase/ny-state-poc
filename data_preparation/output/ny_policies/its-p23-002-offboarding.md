| Offboarding                                       |

## $^{ }$1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The Office of Information Technology Services ("ITS") is entrusted with managing the User accounts and access privileges of ITS and its supported agencies ("Client Agency"). Part of managing these accounts means maintaining standardized offboarding of User accounts upon State employee, contractor, or consultant (collectively referred to herein as "User(s)") separation from ITS or a Client Agency.

Offboarding is the process used to revoke accounts and access from separating Users. Proper offboarding is necessary to facilitate the appropriate deactivation of accounts, to ensure ITS and Client Agencies meet their legal obligations on this topic, and to secure the return of all ITS-owned equipment and assets. Proper offboarding also ensures the security of state resources and data.

This policy outlines the importance of appropriate offboarding, defines specific types of offboarding, and ultimately establishes a collaborative workflow that involves ITS technical staff, ITS Enterprise eDiscovery Services ("EES"), and Client Agency legal counsel, or their designee.

## $^{ }$2.0 Authority

Section 1 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, charges the State Chief Information Officer ("CIO") with overseeing and supervising the management and operations of ITS . Section 102(2) of the State Technology Law gives the Director of ITS

responsibility for the administration of ITS. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish State Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policy, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This policy applies to ITS employees, contractors, consultants, and ITS supported agencies ("Client Agency").

This policy applies to the User account(s) assigned to a specific User. $_{4.0 Information Statement }$

The employing agency, ITS or its Client Agency, must complete the types of offboarding described herein based on need and potential risk to the agency. ITS will assist the Client Agency by disabling the User's access to accounts, technology, and associated assets. There are several services included in the ITS Offboarding and Deprovisioning process to ensure the appropriate deactivation of accounts, to ensure legal obligations are met, and to secure the return of all ITS-owned equipment and assets.

Failure to offboard appropriately can lead to the loss of necessary data and can result in legal implications. EES is a Business Unit within the ITS Division of Legal Affairs ("DLA") under the leadership of the Chief General Counsel. EES provides legal preservation services to ITS and Client Agencies for both email and non-email electronically stored information ("ESI"). During the offboarding process, to the extent the employing agency, ITS or a Client Agency, identifies a legal preservation obligation related to the separating User, it can engage EES to assist in meeting those obligations.

## 4.1 Types of offboarding

There are three (3) types of offboarding: Standard, Immediate, and Emergency. Please review the following to determine which is required.

1. Standard: This is a typical offboarding in which a User is separating from the employing agency. The employing agency must submit Standard offboarding requests anywhere between 2 - 14 days prior to the requested decommission date, as defined in KB0027621 via utilizing the ITS ticketing system ("ITSM") and searching "Employee Offboarding." The requested decommission date is defined as the last day that an employee/contractor/consultant is being paid by a NYS entity, with specific access turned off prior to that date if necessary.

2. Immediate : This is a lower risk offboarding that should have been submitted as Standard, but the time period lapsed, or the agency was recently notified of the separation. The employing agency must submit immediate offboarding requests as soon as possible via utilizing ITSM and searching "Employee Offboarding."

The employing agency must submit immediate offboarding requests within twenty-four (24) hours, or earlier if possible. After submission, the applicable ITS Client Relationship Manager ("CRM") must be separately informed of the request for immediate offboarding if the separating User is from a Client Agency.

3. Emergency : This type of offboarding is due to User termination or a separation in which there is a potential risk to the agency if all access is not immediately disabled. The employing agency must get approval for these requests from their agency's Chief Legal Officer and must forward the requests to the ITS EES team shared mailbox at its.sm.ees@its.ny.gov for action. These offboarding requests cannot be processed through ITSM. Emergency offboarding can be scheduled with the ITS EES team if access termination is required outside of normal business hours (8A - 5P, Monday through Friday). Any requests outside of normal business hours will be handled on a "best-effort basis" until the following business day. Once the offboarding is complete, the employing agency must submit an offboarding request via utilizing ITSM and searching "Employee Offboarding" for tracking and equipment retrieval purposes.

## 4.2 Legal Obligations and the Attestation Clause

Once a User is offboarded the employing agency will no longer have access to the User's home drive or mobile device data. Home drive data will be purged in accordance with ITS-P21-005, Offboarding and Automatic Deprovisioning of Mailbox and Home drive(s). An offboarding will not affect legal holds placed on a user's account(s) in the O365 eDiscovery solution.

The person submitting the offboarding request must check an attestation box confirming that they consulted the Client Agency legal department regarding any pending legal preservation and retention obligations pursuant to ITS-P18-007 and ITSP21-001, and that they are authorized to submit the request for the devices to be returned to ITS for sanitization. The employing agency must determine their legal hold obligations.

If a legal preservation obligation exists, and the employing agency must maintain the User's data, the employing agency legal department must contact the ITS EES team at its.sm.ees@its.ny.gov for assistance.

## 5.0 Compliance

This policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time. Compliance with amended policies and standards is required.

If compliance with this policy is not feasible or technically possible, or if deviation from this policy is necessary to support a business function, Client Agency's must request an exception from the EES team via the following email address: its.sm.ees@its.ny.gov.
