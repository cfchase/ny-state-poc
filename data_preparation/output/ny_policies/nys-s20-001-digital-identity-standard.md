| IT Standard                                      | :  Updated:  05/20/2021                                    |
| Digital Identity                                 | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services |

## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

The purpose of this standard is to establish the rules and processes for maintaining and protecting New York State (NYS) identity data, including the tokens and credentials issued and bound to each identity.

The standard establishes a trustworthy process, based on National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity standards, for

· Identity proofing individuals.

· Managing authentication credentials that are tied to an individual's digital identity.

· Connecting that digital identity to the individual.

## 2.0 Authority

Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides the Office of Information Technology Services (ITS) with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering. Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines .

## 3.0 Scope

This standard applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" entities in Executive Order 117, established January 2002, or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments; consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any ITS resource for which ITS the SE has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the ITS SE. While an SE may adopt a different standard, it must include the requirements set forth in this one.

This standard covers all systems developed by, or on behalf of, NYS that require authenticated access. This includes all test, quality control, production; and other ad hoc systems .

This  standard applies to the authentication of individuals of NYS applications and systems for the purposes of conducting government business electronically .

## 4.0 Information Statement

NYS has generally adopted the NIST 800-63-3: Digital Identity_Guidelines; as the basis for electronic authentication standards where applicable and practical.

## 4.1 Enrollment and Identity Proofing

This section outlines the requirements for enrollment and identity proofing of applicants requesting access to resources at each Identity Assurance Level (IAL) The tables below reflect the Identity Assurance Levels determined by performing the Identity Assurance Level Assessment  Process in Appendix B of  the NYS-P2O-001 Digital Identity_Policy. Additionally; technical guidance from NIST_ 800-63A_Diqital_Identity Guidelines: Enrollment and_Identity_Proofing is included in the tables below that will assist Registration Authorities (RA), Credential Service Providers (CSP), and Information Owners in identifying and implementing the appropriate technical requirements.


| IAL   | Description                                              |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|       | Low or no confidence in the asserted identity s validity |
| 2     | Confidence in the asserted identity' s validity          |
| 3     | High confidence in the asserted identity' s validity     |

Identity Resolution The CSP collects personally identifiable information (PII) from the person; such as name, address; date of birth; email, and phone number. See Appendix A for the different levels of strength for identity evidence (unacceptable weak, fair, strong, superior), including the minimum requirements at each level, to establish a valid identity.

## 4.2 Authenticator Lifecycle Management

There are various events across the lifecycle of an authenticator that affect its use. Events include binding, loss, theft, damage, unauthorized duplication, expiration, revocation and termination. The following tables will reflect the level of confidence at each Authenticator Assurance Level (AAL) that is achieved by performing the AAL Assessment Process in Appendix C in the NYS-P20-001 Digital Identity Policy.
