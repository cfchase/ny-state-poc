    ## 1.0 Purpose and Benefits

      This policy outlines the process for the surplus and/or secure disposal of New York State (NYS) Office of 
               Information Technology Services (ITS) owned or managed electronic equipment (E-equipment), furniture, 
               miscellaneous equipment, and vehicles. This policy safeguards state assets, creates efficiency in 
               surplusing or scrapping, maximizes the value received for property that is surplus to the State's needs, 
               and is attentive to environmental impacts.
      
      In order to effectively surplus and dispose of items no longer of use, and which have no value, the ITS surplus 
               and disposal process has been established based on guidelines provided by the Office of General Services
               (OGS) and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.

      ## 2.0 Authority
      
      Section 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology 
      policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established 
      January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate
      the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including 
      hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering.
      
      Details regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise 
      Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.
      
      State Finance Law (SFL) ยง167 and ยง168 set forth the legal requirements for the transfer and disposal of 
      State-owned personal property which has been determined to be no longer useful and may be surplused or 
      disposed of by the State agencies having custody or control of such property excluding vehicles, which is 
      determined by OGS.

      ## 4.0 Information Statement
      
      It is the responsibility of each ITS business unit to understand and comply with this policy. When a business 
      unit is in possession of ITS-owned personal property it no longer needs or uses, and it cannot be traded in to 
      the manufacturer for credit toward purchasing a new item, either a Surplus/LDA Request must be entered into ITSM, 
      or a CS-201 Form must be completed.
      
      ## 4.1 E-Equipment
      
      E-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not 
      limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers,
      printers, and data center equipment. The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO) 
      guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.
      Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA 
      Service Request.
      
      As established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision 
      policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment, 
      no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before 
      turning over equipment to ITS.
      
      In accordance with Section 168 of the SFL, prior to surplus or disposal of E-equipment, consideration 
      should be given to donating to the Computer Recycling for Education and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) program.
      This program was created to take computer equipment that is no longer needed by the state and private industry 
      and distribute to schools, libraries, and other educational institutions.

      ## 4.2 Furniture and Miscellaneous Equipment
      
      If the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will 
      re-deploy the item to a new location or individual.
      
      If the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to have value but is no longer needed for ITS 
      use (i.e., items that are still in reasonably good shape and/or still function properly but are no longer 
      needed by the business unit), a CS-201 Form must be completed and, if applicable, the Information Security 
      Certification must be signed. The completed form, along with digital pictures, must be sent to ITS Facilities 
      Services at its.sm.surplus@its.ny.gov, for authorization and processing. Once all approvals are in place, 
      ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the furniture or miscellaneous equipment drop-off with OGS.
      
      ITS Facilities Services will work with the business unit to review the form. If the form is complete, 
      ITS Facilities Services will approve and authorize the disposal of furniture or miscellaneous equipment. 
      If the form is incomplete, it will be returned to the requestor for revision. Furniture and miscellaneous 
      equipment cannot be removed without the proper approval and authorization as indicated above.
      
      In all cases, until a final determination is made by ITS Facilities Services, the business unit is 
      responsible for storing items. There is no ITS centralized warehouse area to hold furniture or miscellaneous
      equipment.

      ## 4.3 Vehicles
  
      When a business unit determines a State Vehicle should be removed from service, the business unit must notify ITS
      Facilities Services. If the vehicle is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will deploy it to a new 
      location. If ITS Facilities Services determines the vehicle will be surplused, the following actions are to be 
      taken:
        
        ยท All decals, etc., except for inspection and registration stickers, must be removed and the vehicle cleaned 
          inside and out.
        
        ยท The vehicle is to be transported to the Swan Street location if the normal assigned parking for that vehicle
          is not in Albany/Capital District.
        
        When the State Vehicle is turned in to ITS Facilities Services, all related items such as gas cards, 
      Fleet Service cards/manuals, E-ZPass tags, and completed/signed mileage reports are also to be turned in.
        
        ITS Facilities Services will process the State Vehicle to OGS for auction, transfer, or disposal by filling
      out a Report of Surplus Motor Vehicles and Motorized Equipment, CS-201.1 Form. ITS Facilities Services will 
      further notify all concerned parties that the vehicle is no longer in service.
        
        Once all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the State Vehicle drop-off with OGS.

      ## 5.0 Compliance
      
      This policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all ITS policies and standards. 
      ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.
      
      Since these items of personal property were purchased with government funds, the law requires agencies to
      follow these procedures and the OGS guidelines to recoup their value by re-using the items or selling them to 
      the public. Willful failure to follow these procedures and the OGS guidelines is a violation of law which may
      result in a charge of misconduct or other penalties. Your primary responsibility as an ITS employee is to notify 
      ITS Facilities Services when you have an item of ITS personal property (i.e., eequipment, furniture, miscellaneous 
      equipment, and vehicles) for which you no longer have a business need.
      
      SFL ยง167 establishes OGS as the State agency responsible for transferring surplus equipment from one State 
      department/agency to another State department/agency. Please refer to and review the OGS website for OGS current 
      procedures and forms for the surplus of State property: https://ogs.ny.gov/state-surplus-property-program.
