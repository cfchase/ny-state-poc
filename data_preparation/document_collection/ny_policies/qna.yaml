      | Acceptable Use of  Artificial Intelligence  Technologies | Issued By:  NYS Office of Information  Technology Services  Owner: Chief Data Office |

      # Title: **1.0 Purpose and Benefits**

      The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the acceptable use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, as defined here within, by State Entities (SE). Through the responsible use of AI, SEs can drive innovation, increase operational efficiencies, and better serve New Yorkers while protecting privacy, managing risk, and promoting accountability, safety, and equity. Agencies are encouraged to responsibly adopt AI technologies and should consider this policy a tool to aid in that adoption.

  - context: |
      Telecommuting is an alternate work arrangement that allows employees to conduct some of their work away from their official work site. ITS's policy is to support telecommuting where it is reasonable to do so based on the agency's mission and operational needs.

      The Telecommuting Program is completely voluntary. Every application will be considered on an individual basis. ITS reserves the right to unilaterally approve, disapprove, modify, revoke, or suspend any individual's participation in this program pursuant to procedures outlined in Section 4.3.5.
      Telecommuting is not operationally feasible for all job functions.
      The Bureau Director, or designee, determines which job functions are eligible to participate in this program. Determinations as to which job functions are eligible for telecommuting are final and cannot be appealed.

      This program will sunset on June 30, 2025 but can be extended at the discretion of ITS. ITS will comply with any current or future obligations under collective bargaining agreements regarding telecommuting, including meeting with union representatives prior to the termination of the Telecommuting Program if required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.

      ## **4.1 Types of Telecommuting**

      Event Driven - Occasional telecommuting arrangement that is infrequent and not regularly scheduled, which is approved or directed by the Division Executive, or their designee.

      Regularly Scheduled - Routine telecommuting arrangement with a set schedule.

      Exceptions - A telecommuting arrangement that exceeds 50% of the telecommuter's regularly scheduled work hours in a pay period and requested on a temporary and adhoc basis. These requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

      ## **4.3 Key Management**

      The SE must ensure that a secure environment is established to protect the cryptographic keys used to encrypt and decrypt information.

      · Keys must be securely distributed and stored.

      · Unencrypted keys must not be stored with the data that they encrypt.

      Access to keys must be restricted to only individuals who have a business need to access the keys.

      Keys will be protected with an authentication token that conforms to the identified assurance level as per the NYS-P20-001 Digital Identity Policy.

      Compromise of a cryptographic key would cause all information encrypted with that key to be considered unencrypted. If a compromise has been discovered, a new key must be generated and used to continue protection of the encrypted information. Specific circumstances should be evaluated to determine if a breach notification is required.

      Encryption keys and their associated software products must be maintained for the life of the archived data that was encrypted with that product.

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What measures must be taken to ensure the security of cryptographic keys?
        answer: |
          Cryptographic keys must be securely distributed and stored. Unencrypted keys must not be stored with the data that they encrypt.
      - question: |
          Who has access to ITS encryption keys?
        answer: |
          Access to encryption keys must be restricted to only individuals who have a business need to access the keys.
      - question: |
          What should be done if a cryptographic key is compromised?
        answer: |
          If an encrpytion key has been compromised, a new key must be generated and used to continue protection of the encrypted information.
          Specific circumstances should be evaluated to determine if a breach notification is required.

      ## 4.0 Information Statement

      It is the responsibility of each ITS business unit to understand and comply with this policy. When a business
      unit is in possession of ITS-owned personal property it no longer needs or uses, and it cannot be traded in to
      the manufacturer for credit toward purchasing a new item, either a Surplus/LDA Request must be entered into ITSM,
      or a CS-201 Form must be completed.

      ## 4.1 E-Equipment

      E-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not
      limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers,
      printers, and data center equipment. The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO)
      guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.
      Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA
      Service Request.

      As established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision
      policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment,
      no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before
      turning over equipment to ITS.

      In accordance with Section 168 of the SFL, prior to surplus or disposal of E-equipment, consideration
      should be given to donating to the Computer Recycling for Education and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) program.
      This program was created to take computer equipment that is no longer needed by the state and private industry
      and distribute to schools, libraries, and other educational institutions.
