      4.3 Device Replacement In the event that a device fails, the device will be repaired or replaced at the discretion
      of ITS. If a device is replaced, the replacement device will be materially similar in function and may be new, 
      used, or refurbished.
      
      Client Agency funded devices, supported by ITS, which are replaced outside of a warranty period must be funded by the Client Agency.
      
      4.4 Lost or Stolen Devices In the event a device is lost, stolen, or otherwise unreturnable, the user or the 
      user’s supervisor must immediately notify ITS and their agency. ITS will confirm data encryption and update the 
      statewide inventory, noting the device’s status. The user must also consult their agency’s Chief Legal Counsel 
      regarding their agency’s legal obligations related to a lost or stolen device, as well as compliance with the 
      Office of the State Comptroller’s Guide to Financial Operations Chapter XII.10.E – Reporting the Theft, Loss 
      or Misuse of State Assets, if applicable. ITS does not report a Client Agency’s lost or stolen device to the 
      Office of the State Comptroller.
      
      4.5 Compromised Devices If a device is potentially compromised, the user or other custodian must notify the 
      agency’s Chief Legal Counsel to arrange return. It is the responsibility of the Client Agency to attempt 
      recovery of the device and notify ITS to arrange return to ITS. ITS will confirm data encryption and update 
      the statewide inventory, noting the device’s status. A compromised device is a device that was left outside 
      of the care of the assigned user due to the death, incarceration, or other unusual circumstance leaving the 
      user unable to return the device. 4.5 Device Management Devices issued to custodians must be managed by using
      an ITS designated configuration management solution and joined to a designated directory service.
      Issued devices are expected to be in active use. Devices which are powered down, disconnected from networks, 
      or otherwise isolated from ITS management services for extended periods of time must be recorded as lost by the 
      custodian, unless appropriate arrangements are made for storage when not in use.
