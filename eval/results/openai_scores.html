The vehicle is then transported to the Swan Street location if it wasn't originally assigned parking in Albany/Capital District. Once turned in to ITS Facilities Services, all related items are processed for auction, transfer, or disposal by filling out a Report of Surplus Motor Vehicles and Motorized Equipment, CS-201.1 Form. ITS Facilities Services will then notify all concerned parties that the vehicle is no longer in service.</td>

Regularly Scheduled: Routine telecommuting arrangements with a set schedule.\n3. Exceptions: Telecommuting arrangements that exceed 50% of the telecommuter's regularly scheduled work hours in a pay period and requested on a temporary and ad hoc basis. These requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n4. Exceptions - Employees in Training: Telecommuting arrangements for employees in training programs, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n5. Exceptions - Summer Hours: Telecommuting arrangements during the summer months, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThese telecommuting options provide flexibility for ITS employees to balance their work and personal lives while maintaining productivity and meeting the agency's operational needs.</td>

      <td>The reference answer highlights several key benefits of the Use of Artificial Intelligence policy: driving innovation, increasing operational efficiencies, better serving New Yorkers, protecting privacy, managing risk, and promoting accountability, safety, and equity. The model answer covers some of these aspects: it mentions innovation, increased efficiency, and compliance (which can relate to managing risk and promoting accountability). However, it does not explicitly mention protecting privacy, safety, or equity, nor does it specifically address serving New Yorkers. The model answer does include additional benefits such as enhanced decision-making and improved customer experience, which are not mentioned in the reference answer.

      <td>## 4.1 E-Equipment\n\nE-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers, printers, and data center equipment. The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO) guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA Service Request.\n\nAs established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment, no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before turning over equipment to ITS.\n\nITS Facilities Services will work with the business unit to review the form. If the form is complete, ITS Facilities Services will approve and authorize the disposal of furniture or miscellaneous equipment. If the form is incomplete, it will be returned to the requestor for revision. Furniture and miscellaneous equipment cannot be removed without the proper approval and authorization as indicated above.\n\nIn all cases, until a final determination is made by ITS Facilities Services, the business unit is responsible for storing items. There is no ITS centralized warehouse area to hold furniture or miscellaneous equipment.\n\n## 4.3 Vehicles\n\nWhen a business unit determines a State Vehicle should be removed from service, the business unit must notify ITS Facilities Services. If the vehicle is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will deploy it to a new location. If ITS Facilities Services determines the vehicle will be surplused, the following actions are to be taken:\n\nIf the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to have value but is no longer needed for ITS use (i.e., items that are still in reasonably good shape and/or still function properly but are no longer needed by the business unit), a CS-201 Form must be completed and, if applicable, the Information Security Certification must be signed. The completed form, along with digital pictures, must be sent to ITS Facilities Services at its.sm.surplus@its.ny.gov, for authorization and processing. Once all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the furniture or miscellaneous equipment drop-off with OGS.\n\nIn order to effectively surplus and dispose of items no longer of use, and which have no value, the ITS surplus and disposal process has been established based on guidelines provided by the Office of General Services (OGS) and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering.\n\nDetails regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.</td>

The purpose is to maximize the impact and benefit of using OSS and to ensure that any technical, legal, or business risks resulting from that usage are properly mitigated. OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs. Unlike other software, OSS makes its source code freely available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nAt minimum, OSS must meet these four (4) conditions to be reviewed:\n\n- 2. The source code of the software must be available on the Internet.\n- 1. The software must be free to use.\n- 3. The license to use the software must be approved by the ITS Division of Legal Affairs (DLA). A list of approved licenses is listed in Appendix A: Pre-Screened Open Source Licenses.\n- 4. The user is not required to agree to terms or conditions prior to the download; or, DLA has approved the terms and conditions associated with the OSS. 2\n\nOSS options should be considered first for all potential software solutions. A list of approved OSS can be accessed on the ITS Approved Software List.\n\n## 5.0 Compliance\n\nThis policy shall take effect upon publication.

The purpose is to maximize the impact and benefit of using OSS and to ensure that any technical, legal, or business risks resulting from that usage are properly mitigated. OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs. Unlike other software, OSS makes its source code freely available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nAt minimum, OSS must meet these four (4) conditions to be reviewed:\n\n- 2. The source code of the software must be available on the Internet.\n- 1. The software must be free to use.\n- 3. The license to use the software must be approved by the ITS Division of Legal Affairs (DLA). A list of approved licenses is listed in Appendix A: Pre-Screened Open Source Licenses.\n- 4. The user is not required to agree to terms or conditions prior to the download; or, DLA has approved the terms and conditions associated with the OSS. 2\n\nOSS options should be considered first for all potential software solutions. A list of approved OSS can be accessed on the ITS Approved Software List.\n\n## 5.0 Compliance\n\nThis policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.\n\n## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nSection 1 of Executive Order No. 117 1 charges the State Chief Information Officer with Technology Services (ITS) .

      <td>ITS sees several benefits in Open-source software (OSS). First, OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs. This is because the source code of OSS is freely available, which means that ITS does not have to pay for the software. Additionally, OSS allows ITS to leverage the work of a community of developers who are constantly improving and updating the software. This can lead to faster development times and more robust software.\n\nAnother benefit of OSS is that it can help ITS maintain an agency culture that supports employee flexibility and mobility. This is because OSS is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers, which means that ITS can tap into a global pool of talent. This can help ITS attract and retain high-quality employees who are looking for a flexible and mobile work environment.\n\nFinally, OSS can help ITS promote resiliency during work site disruptions, including modified and suspended operations. This is because OSS is often available under an open license, which means that ITS can use the software even if the vendor goes out of business or stops supporting the software. This can help ITS ensure that its critical systems continue to operate even in the face of unexpected disruptions.</td>

      <td>The reference answer highlights one key benefit of Open-source software (OSS) for ITS: the opportunity to reduce development and operational costs. The model answer covers this key point by stating that OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs because the source code is freely available, which means ITS does not have to pay for the software. Additionally, the model answer expands on this by mentioning other benefits such as leveraging a community of developers for faster development times, maintaining a flexible and mobile work environment, and promoting resiliency during work site disruptions. While these additional points are not mentioned in the reference answer, they do not contradict it and provide further context and potential benefits of OSS. Therefore, the model answer is mostly correct, accurate, and factual in relation to the reference answer.</td>

      <td>## 3.2 Definitions and Covered Use\n\nThis policy applies to all technology systems that deploy AI technology, hereafter referred to as "AI systems." For the purposes of this policy, AI is defined as a machinebased system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.\n\nThe definition includes but is not limited to systems that use machine learning, large language model, natural language processing, and computer vision technologies, including generative AI. 2 The definition does not include basic calculations, basic automation, or pre-recorded "if this then that (IFTT)" response systems.\n\n&lt;!-- image --&gt;\n\nState Capitol P.O.

      <td>No there is not a centralized ITS warehouse to store eqipment. Business units are responsible for storing items.</td>
      <td>## 4.1 E-Equipment\n\nE-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers, printers, and data center equipment. The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO) guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA Service Request.\n\nAs established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment, no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before turning over equipment to ITS.\n\nITS Facilities Services will work with the business unit to review the form. If the form is complete, ITS Facilities Services will approve and authorize the disposal of furniture or miscellaneous equipment. If the form is incomplete, it will be returned to the requestor for revision. Furniture and miscellaneous equipment cannot be removed without the proper approval and authorization as indicated above.\n\nIn all cases, until a final determination is made by ITS Facilities Services, the business unit is responsible for storing items. There is no ITS centralized warehouse area to hold furniture or miscellaneous equipment.\n\n## 4.3 Vehicles\n\nWhen a business unit determines a State Vehicle should be removed from service, the business unit must notify ITS Facilities Services. If the vehicle is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will deploy it to a new location. If ITS Facilities Services determines the vehicle will be surplused, the following actions are to be taken:\n\nIf the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to have value but is no longer needed for ITS use (i.e., items that are still in reasonably good shape and/or still function properly but are no longer needed by the business unit), a CS-201 Form must be completed and, if applicable, the Information Security Certification must be signed. The completed form, along with digital pictures, must be sent to ITS Facilities Services at its.sm.surplus@its.ny.gov, for authorization and processing. Once all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the furniture or miscellaneous equipment drop-off with OGS.\n\nIn order to effectively surplus and dispose of items no longer of use, and which have no value, the ITS surplus and disposal process has been established based on guidelines provided by the Office of General Services (OGS) and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering.\n\nDetails regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.</td>

This policy applies to all New York State e-equipment and personal property owned and managed by ITS.\n\n## 4.0 Information Statement\n\nIt is the responsibility of each ITS business unit to understand and comply with this policy. When a business unit is in possession of ITS-owned personal property it no longer needs or uses, and it cannot be traded in to the manufacturer for credit toward purchasing a new item, either a Surplus/LDA Request must be entered into ITSM, or a CS-201 Form must be completed.</td>

The purpose is to maximize the impact and benefit of using OSS and to ensure that any technical, legal, or business risks resulting from that usage are properly mitigated. OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs. Unlike other software, OSS makes its source code freely available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nAt minimum, OSS must meet these four (4) conditions to be reviewed:\n\n- 2. The source code of the software must be available on the Internet.\n- 1. The software must be free to use.\n- 3. The license to use the software must be approved by the ITS Division of Legal Affairs (DLA). A list of approved licenses is listed in Appendix A: Pre-Screened Open Source Licenses.\n- 4. The user is not required to agree to terms or conditions prior to the download; or, DLA has approved the terms and conditions associated with the OSS. 2\n\nOSS options should be considered first for all potential software solutions. A list of approved OSS can be accessed on the ITS Approved Software List.\n\n## 5.0 Compliance\n\nThis policy shall take effect upon publication.

The use of AI, even if not subject to this policy, must be in compliance with applicable New York State and ITS policies and standards and New York and federal law. Particular attention should be made to the use of Open-Source AI to ensure compliance with ITS-P19-005: Acceptable Use of Open Source Software, where applicable. Additionally, SEs must maintain awareness of how the AI system uses personally identifiable, confidential, or sensitive information to ensure such use complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, notices, and policies. SEs are required to have SE leadership approval prior to adopting new AI systems.

      <td>Is there a centralized ITS warehouse to store equipments?</td>
      <td>No there is not a centralized ITS warehouse to store eqipment. Business units are responsible for storing items.</td>
      <td>## 4.1 E-Equipment\n\nE-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers, printers, and data center equipment. The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO) guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA Service Request.\n\nAs established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment, no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before turning over equipment to ITS.\n\nITS Facilities Services will work with the business unit to review the form. If the form is complete, ITS Facilities Services will approve and authorize the disposal of furniture or miscellaneous equipment. If the form is incomplete, it will be returned to the requestor for revision. Furniture and miscellaneous equipment cannot be removed without the proper approval and authorization as indicated above.\n\nIn all cases, until a final determination is made by ITS Facilities Services, the business unit is responsible for storing items. There is no ITS centralized warehouse area to hold furniture or miscellaneous equipment.\n\n## 4.3 Vehicles\n\nWhen a business unit determines a State Vehicle should be removed from service, the business unit must notify ITS Facilities Services. If the vehicle is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will deploy it to a new location. If ITS Facilities Services determines the vehicle will be surplused, the following actions are to be taken:\n\nIf the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to have value but is no longer needed for ITS use (i.e., items that are still in reasonably good shape and/or still function properly but are no longer needed by the business unit), a CS-201 Form must be completed and, if applicable, the Information Security Certification must be signed. The completed form, along with digital pictures, must be sent to ITS Facilities Services at its.sm.surplus@its.ny.gov, for authorization and processing. Once all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the furniture or miscellaneous equipment drop-off with OGS.\n\nIn order to effectively surplus and dispose of items no longer of use, and which have no value, the ITS surplus and disposal process has been established based on guidelines provided by the Office of General Services (OGS) and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering.\n\nDetails regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.</td>

      <td>The reference answer provides two key facts: 1) There is no centralized ITS warehouse to store equipment, and 2) Business units are responsible for storing items. The model answer covers both of these key facts accurately. Additionally, the model answer provides extra detail by mentioning that the business unit is responsible for storing items until a final determination is made by ITS Facilities Services. This additional detail does not contradict the reference answer and provides further context.

This policy applies to all New York State e-equipment and personal property owned and managed by ITS.\n\n## 4.0 Information Statement\n\nIt is the responsibility of each ITS business unit to understand and comply with this policy. When a business unit is in possession of ITS-owned personal property it no longer needs or uses, and it cannot be traded in to the manufacturer for credit toward purchasing a new item, either a Surplus/LDA Request must be entered into ITSM, or a CS-201 Form must be completed.</td>

The use of AI, even if not subject to this policy, must be in compliance with applicable New York State and ITS policies and standards and New York and federal law. Particular attention should be made to the use of Open-Source AI to ensure compliance with ITS-P19-005: Acceptable Use of Open Source Software, where applicable. Additionally, SEs must maintain awareness of how the AI system uses personally identifiable, confidential, or sensitive information to ensure such use complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, notices, and policies. SEs are required to have SE leadership approval prior to adopting new AI systems. Such approval should include SE executive legal and operational leadership, including the SE's ethics officer. 4</td>

SEs are required to have SE leadership approval prior to adopting new AI systems. Such approval should include SE executive legal and operational leadership, including the SE's ethics officer. 4\n\n&lt;!-- image --&gt;\n\nState Capitol P.O.

Through the responsible use of AI, SEs can drive innovation, increase operational efficiencies, and better serve New Yorkers while protecting privacy, managing risk, and promoting accountability, safety, and equity. Agencies are encouraged to responsibly adopt AI technologies and should consider this policy a tool to aid in that adoption.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nThe SE must identify an Information Owner for each AI system that meets the criteria set forth in Section 3.2. For examples of acceptable and unacceptable uses of AI systems, please see Appendix A to this policy.\n\n## 4.2 Human Oversight\n\nAI systems aid and enhance human decision making that may impact the public. SEs must ensure that decisions that impact the public are not made without oversight by appropriate staff, who make the final decisions. Automated final decision systems are not permitted.\n\nSEs shall take steps to ensure that where AI systems are used to aid in decision making that impacts the public, the outcomes, decisions, and supporting methodologies of such AI systems are documented appropriately. 5 The Information Owner is responsible for periodically assessing the outputs of their in-production AI systems to validate continuing reliability, safety, and fairness.\n\n## 4.3 Fairness and Equity, and Explain Ability</td>

If denied, the employee may appeal the decision in writing as outlined in Section 4.4.\n\nThe supervisor may require an employee to submit a new telecommuting application if the employee leaves the current position or program area or if the employee's job duties or function significantly changes.\n\n## 4.3.3 Renewal\n\nIndividual telecommuting agreements may be suspended or terminated for any other reason at any time by the agency with thirty days' notice where feasible and consistent with agency operating needs. The telecommuter may suspend or withdraw from telecommuting at any time with prior notice to the supervisor.\n\nEmployees who have been removed from the Telecommuting Program may reapply for participation no sooner than six months from the date of removal.\n\n## 4.4 Appeal Process\n\nIf an employee has their application denied, the employee may request a review by the Telecommuting Appeal Board within five (5) business days of receipt of the denial. The Telecommuting Appeal Board shall consist of a representative from ITS Division of Legal Affairs, ITS Office of Administration, and ITS Human Resources.\n\nThe employee will receive instructions through their ITS email on how to engage in the appeal process.\n\nThe Telecommuting Program is completely voluntary. Every application will be considered on an individual basis. ITS reserves the right to unilaterally approve, disapprove, modify, revoke, or suspend any individual's participation in this program pursuant to procedures outlined in Section 4.3.5. Telecommuting is not operationally feasible for all job functions. The Bureau Director, or designee, determines which job functions are eligible to participate in this program. Determinations as to which job functions are eligible for telecommuting are final and cannot be appealed.\n\nThis program will sunset on June 30, 2025 but can be extended at the discretion of ITS. ITS will comply with any current or future obligations under collective bargaining agreements regarding telecommuting, including meeting with union representatives prior to the termination of the Telecommuting Program if required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.\n\n## 4.1 Types of Telecommuting\n\n- · Requests must be made in writing to its.sm.Administration@its.ny.gov within five (5) business days of the denial.\n- · Requests must contain information regarding why the employee disagrees with the determination, along with any new information for the Appeal Board to consider.\n- · Appeals will generally be heard within ten (10) business days of receipt.\n- · Employees will be notified in writing of the Appeal Board's determination.\n\nDenials of applications for telecommuting under the Telecommuting Program are not grievable under any collective bargaining agreements. The employee may submit a new application six (6) months after the date of the appeal denial or earlier as determined by their supervisor.\n\n## 4.5 Reasonable Accommodations</td>
