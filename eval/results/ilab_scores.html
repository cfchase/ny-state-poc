The same attendance rules and call-in procedures apply when telecommuting. Official work site coverage will be among the considerations made by the employee's supervisor when making telecommuting decisions. Seniority may be used as a factor in the approval of a telecommuting day.\n\nSupervisors shall require telecommuters to have a set telecommuting schedule. The approved set schedule is determined by the employee's supervisor based on operational needs. Any request for a change in an approved set schedule or telecommuting day must be submitted to the supervisor in advance.\n\nThe Telecommuting Program is completely voluntary. Every application will be considered on an individual basis. ITS reserves the right to unilaterally approve, disapprove, modify, revoke, or suspend any individual's participation in this program pursuant to procedures outlined in Section 4.3.5. Telecommuting is not operationally feasible for all job functions. The Bureau Director, or designee, determines which job functions are eligible to participate in this program. Determinations as to which job functions are eligible for telecommuting are final and cannot be appealed.\n\nThis program will sunset on June 30, 2025 but can be extended at the discretion of ITS. ITS will comply with any current or future obligations under collective bargaining agreements regarding telecommuting, including meeting with union representatives prior to the termination of the Telecommuting Program if required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.\n\n## 4.1 Types of Telecommuting\n\n| 12/06/2023 | Revised to reflect changes in the  telecommuting program.       | Administration                  |\n| 07/05/2024 | Revised to reflect changes in the  telecommuting program.       | Administration                  |</td>

      <td>ITS sees several benefits in Open-source software (OSS). First, OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs. This is because the source code of OSS is freely available, which means that ITS does not have to pay for the software. Additionally, OSS allows ITS to leverage the work of a community of developers who are constantly improving and updating the software. This can lead to faster development times and more robust software.\n\nAnother benefit of OSS is that it can help ITS maintain an agency culture that supports employee flexibility and mobility. This is because OSS is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers, which means that ITS can tap into a global pool of talent. This can help ITS attract and retain high-quality employees who are looking for a flexible and mobile work environment.\n\nFinally, OSS can help ITS promote resiliency during work site disruptions, including modified and suspended operations. This is because OSS is often available under an open license, which means that ITS can use the software even if the vendor goes out of business or stops supporting the software. This can help ITS ensure that its critical systems continue to operate even in the face of unexpected disruptions.</td>

Statewide services that would be best represented by a general term would be an infrequent exception to this rule (e.g., desktop.ny.gov, login.ny.gov).\n- · Use short URLs over a separate or sub-domain address, for areas on the same website (e.g., use health.ny.gov/flu instead of flu.health.ny.gov).\n\n- · Be easily understood and recognizable by the residents of New York State Clearly communicate the purpose of the site;\n- · Be easy to type and avoid using confusing characters such as zeroes (0) in place of the letter "O" or the number one (1) in place of the letter "L" (l).\n- · Contain no less than 10 but no more than 36 characters, including the ny.gov portion of the domain name (the "dots" are considered characters - hence subdomains of ny.gov are to have at least 3 characters)\n- · Contain letters, numbers and dashes (-), but no other special characters such as underscores (\_) and blank spaces;\n- · Avoid the use of acronyms whenever possible, unless the acronym meets one of the following conditions:\n- a) The SE is commonly known by the acronym, or\n\nITS has secured the domain "ny.gov" for New York State government entity use.\n\n## 3.0 Scope\n\nThis policy applies to all "State Entities" (SE), defined as "State Government" in Executive Order 117 or "State Agencies" as defined in Section 101 of the State Technology Law. This includes employees and all third parties (such as local governments, consultants, vendors, and contractors) that use or access any IT resource for which the SE or ITS has administrative responsibility, including systems managed or hosted by third parties on behalf of the SE or ITS. While an SE may adopt a different policy, it must include the requirements set forth in this one. Where a conflict exists between this policy/standard and a SE's policy, the more restrictive policy will take precedence.\n\n## 4.0 Information Statement\n\nAll SE websites will use a standard domain naming convention which is determined and enforced by ITS.\n\n## 4.1 Domain Naming Convention\n\nAll domain names must:\n\nOnce a domain has been determined and approved, the appropriate ITS Customer Relations Manager can submit a Service Request ticket to initiate the work required for set up in the ITSM service catalog: Network Services &gt; DNS Entry.\n\n## 4.5 Use of Approved Domains.\n\nSEs should use only ny.gov domains. It is highly discouraged to use any other top-level domain unless the head of the SE explicitly determines another domain is necessary for the proper performance of an SE function. The use of any other domain runs the risk of the domain being lost or acquired by another entity. The ny.gov address ensures the public that it is an official state site and can be trusted.</td>

The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO) guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA Service Request.\n\nAs established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment, no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before turning over equipment to ITS.\n\nITS Facilities Services will work with the business unit to review the form. If the form is complete, ITS Facilities Services will approve and authorize the disposal of furniture or miscellaneous equipment. If the form is incomplete, it will be returned to the requestor for revision. Furniture and miscellaneous equipment cannot be removed without the proper approval and authorization as indicated above.\n\nIn all cases, until a final determination is made by ITS Facilities Services, the business unit is responsible for storing items. There is no ITS centralized warehouse area to hold furniture or miscellaneous equipment.\n\n## 4.3 Vehicles\n\nWhen a business unit determines a State Vehicle should be removed from service, the business unit must notify ITS Facilities Services. If the vehicle is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will deploy it to a new location. If ITS Facilities Services determines the vehicle will be surplused, the following actions are to be taken:\n\nIf the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to have value but is no longer needed for ITS use (i.e., items that are still in reasonably good shape and/or still function properly but are no longer needed by the business unit), a CS-201 Form must be completed and, if applicable, the Information Security Certification must be signed. The completed form, along with digital pictures, must be sent to ITS Facilities Services at its.sm.surplus@its.ny.gov, for authorization and processing. Once all approvals are in place, ITS Facilities Services will coordinate the furniture or miscellaneous equipment drop-off with OGS.\n\nIn order to effectively surplus and dispose of items no longer of use, and which have no value, the ITS surplus and disposal process has been established based on guidelines provided by the Office of General Services (OGS) and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering.\n\nDetails regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.</td>

The source code of the software must be available on the Internet.\n- 1. The software must be free to use.\n- 3. The license to use the software must be approved by the ITS Division of Legal Affairs (DLA). A list of approved licenses is listed in Appendix A: Pre-Screened Open Source Licenses.\n- 4. The user is not required to agree to terms or conditions prior to the download; or, DLA has approved the terms and conditions associated with the OSS. 2\n\nOSS options should be considered first for all potential software solutions. A list of approved OSS can be accessed on the ITS Approved Software List.\n\n## 5.0 Compliance\n\nThis policy shall take effect upon publication. Compliance is required with all enterprise policies and standards. ITS may amend its policies and standards at any time; compliance with amended policies and standards is required.\n\n## 6.0 Definitions of Key Terms\n\n## 4.0 Information Statement\n\n## 4.1 Use of AI\n\nThe SE may use AI systems to further their mission and meet critical business needs. The use of AI, even if not subject to this policy, must be in compliance with applicable New York State and ITS policies and standards and New York and federal law. Particular attention should be made to the use of Open-Source AI to ensure compliance with ITS-P19-005: Acceptable Use of Open Source Software, where applicable.

The use of AI, even if not subject to this policy, must be in compliance with applicable New York State and ITS policies and standards and New York and federal law. Particular attention should be made to the use of Open-Source AI to ensure compliance with ITS-P19-005: Acceptable Use of Open Source Software, where applicable. Additionally, SEs must maintain awareness of how the AI system uses personally identifiable, confidential, or sensitive information to ensure such use complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, notices, and policies. SEs are required to have SE leadership approval prior to adopting new AI systems. Such approval should include SE executive legal and operational leadership, including the SE's ethics officer. 4\n\n&lt;!-- image --&gt;\n\nState Capitol P.O.

Through the responsible use of AI, SEs can drive innovation, increase operational efficiencies, and better serve New Yorkers while protecting privacy, managing risk, and promoting accountability, safety, and equity. Agencies are encouraged to responsibly adopt AI technologies and should consider this policy a tool to aid in that adoption.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nThe SE must identify an Information Owner for each AI system that meets the criteria set forth in Section 3.2. For examples of acceptable and unacceptable uses of AI systems, please see Appendix A to this policy.\n\n## 4.2 Human Oversight\n\nAI systems aid and enhance human decision making that may impact the public. SEs must ensure that decisions that impact the public are not made without oversight by appropriate staff, who make the final decisions. Automated final decision systems are not permitted.\n\nSEs shall take steps to ensure that where AI systems are used to aid in decision making that impacts the public, the outcomes, decisions, and supporting methodologies of such AI systems are documented appropriately. 5 The Information Owner is responsible for periodically assessing the outputs of their in-production AI systems to validate continuing reliability, safety, and fairness.\n\n## 4.3 Fairness and Equity, and Explain Ability</td>

      <td>## 4.1 E-Equipment\n\nE-equipment is hardware used to input, store, process, transmit, and output information, including, but not limited to, desktops, laptops, mobile devices, servers, mobile devices, video conferencing equipment, copiers, printers, and data center equipment. The business unit must follow the Chief Technology Office's (CTO) guidelines for disposition of end of life E-equipment and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard. Once properly prepared for surplus or disposal, the business unit must submit a ITSM ServiceNow Surplus/LDA Service Request.\n\nAs established in, ITS-P21-001 Workplace Computing Device and ITS-P18-007 Mobile Provisioning and Deprovision policies, it is the responsibility of the Client Agency to properly return devices, including E-equipment, no longer needed, and to coordinate with agency legal counsel regarding preservation obligations before turning over equipment to ITS.\n\nIn accordance with Section 168 of the SFL, prior to surplus or disposal of E-equipment, consideration should be given to donating to the Computer Recycling for Education and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) program. This program was created to take computer equipment that is no longer needed by the state and private industry and distribute to schools, libraries, and other educational institutions.\n\n## 4.2 Furniture and Miscellaneous Equipment\n\nIf the furniture or miscellaneous equipment is determined to be reusable, ITS Facilities Services will re-deploy the item to a new location or individual.\n\nIn order to effectively surplus and dispose of items no longer of use, and which have no value, the ITS surplus and disposal process has been established based on guidelines provided by the Office of General Services (OGS) and NYS-S13-003 Sanitization/Secure Disposal Standard.\n\n## 2.0 Authority\n\nSection 103(10) of the State Technology Law provides ITS with the authority to establish statewide technology policies, including technology and security standards. Section 2 of Executive Order No. 117 1 , established January 2002, provides the State Chief Information Officer with the authority to oversee, direct, and coordinate the establishment of information technology policies, protocols, and standards for State government, including hardware, software, security, and business re-engineering.\n\nDetails regarding this authority can be found in NYS ITS Policy, NYS-P08-002 Authority to Establish Enterprise Information Technology (IT) Policies, Standards and Guidelines.\n\nState Finance Law (SFL) §167 and §168 set forth the legal requirements for the transfer and disposal of State-owned personal property which has been determined to be no longer useful and may be surplused or disposed of by the State agencies having custody or control of such property excluding vehicles, which is determined by OGS.\n\n## 3.0 Scope\n\nThis policy document applies to ITS and its employees (including full-time, part-time, and temporary employees), contractors, consultants, volunteers, and interns. This policy applies to all New York State e-equipment and personal property owned and managed by ITS.\n\n## 4.0 Information Statement\n\nIt is the responsibility of each ITS business unit to understand and comply with this policy. When a business unit is in possession of ITS-owned personal property it no longer needs or uses, and it cannot be traded in to the manufacturer for credit toward purchasing a new item, either a Surplus/LDA Request must be entered into ITSM, or a CS-201 Form must be completed.</td>
