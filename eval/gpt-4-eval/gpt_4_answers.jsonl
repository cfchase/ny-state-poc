{"question":"What does 100% State-releated debt retirement represent?","ground_truth":"100% debt retirement means that, under the current repayment plan, the State expects to fully repay the principal for State-related debt.","answer":"","rag_answer":"100% State-related debt retirement represents the complete pay off of a state's outstanding debt. It implies that the State has completely paid off its liabilities and no longer has any outstanding debt associated with it.

However, retiring debt more quickly can increase the State's debt service burden at the expense of other purposes."}
{"question":"What impact does the rate of debt retirement have on the State?","ground_truth":"The rate at which State-related debt is retired or paid off has an impact on the State's ability to recycle debt capacity to finance new capital projects.","answer":"","rag_answer":"The rate at which debt is retired or paid off impacts the State's ability to finance new capital projects. If the State retires debt relatively faster, it frees up debt capacity, allowing it to take on more debt for new projects. However, this also increases debt service costs in the State's operating budget, meaning more of the budget is used for paying off debt rather than other purposes. Over time, retiring debt more quickly increases the State's debt service burden."}
