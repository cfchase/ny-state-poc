      ## Enacted Budget Capital Plan Highlights

      The Capital Plan funds the capital activities of State agencies in a fiscally responsible manner while maintaining affordable levels of debt.
      Capital spending, which is projected to total $17.7 billion in FY 2025, includes investments for roadways, bridges, and transit systems; affordable and supportive housing units; economic development projects; health care facilities; and environmental protection projects.
      Additionally, the Capital Plan continues funding for State parks, and educational, mental health, and correctional facilities.

      Major capital initiatives added or continued in the FY 2025 Enacted Budget include:

      Five-Year Department of Transportation Capital Plan. The Enacted Budget includes approximately $7.7 billion for the third year of a five-year, $33 billion DOT capital plan.
      The DOT capital plan leverages Federal funding commitments made in the IIJA to support the final phases of major infrastructure projects, including the Hunts Point Interstate Access Improvement and the replacement of I-81 in Syracuse.
      The new plan also supports new large-scale projects, including: modernizing the Livingston Avenue Bridge in Albany; reconnecting neighborhoods across the Kensington Expressway in Buffalo; converting Route 17 to I-86 in Orange and Sullivan Counties; and assessing ways to improve road capacity at the Oakdale Merge in Suffolk County.
      The DOT Capital Plan also includes $1 billion for the "Bridge NY" program and $1 billion for the Pave Our Potholes program, and continues funding commitments to local highway and bridge programs.

      ## FY 2025 Debt Retirements

      Retirements represent the annual repayment of principal for State-related debt.
      Retirements are recorded as of the date payment is due to bondholders, rather than the actual date the State makes the cash payment.
      For example, if principal payments are due on April 1, the bonds are considered outstanding on March 31, even if the State is contractually obligated to make payments to the bond trustee prior to that date.

      The rate at which State-related debt is retired or paid off has an impact on the State's ability to recycle debt capacity to finance new capital projects.
      Relatively faster amortization frees up debt capacity but increases debt service costs in the State operating budget.
      Over time the practice of retiring debt more quickly increases the State's debt service burden at the expense of other purposes.

      | Period   | Cumulative Percentage of Existing Debt to  be Retired 1   |
      |----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
      | 5 years  | 14%                                                       |
      | 10 years | 40%                                                       |
      | 15 years | 59%                                                       |
      | 20 years | 77%                                                       |
      | 25 years | 92%                                                       |
      | 30 years | 98%                                                       |
      | 40 years | 100%                                                      |
