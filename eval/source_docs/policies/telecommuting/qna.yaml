      This program will sunset on June 30, 2025 but can be extended at the discretion of ITS. ITS will comply with any current or future obligations under collective bargaining agreements regarding telecommuting, including meeting with union representatives prior to the termination of the Telecommuting Program if required by the applicable collective bargaining agreement.
