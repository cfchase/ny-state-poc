This form is used to document issues with productivity, responsiveness, workspace compliance, technology, or other reasons. However, unsatisfactory performance does not automatically disqualify an employee from telecommuting. The decision to suspend or terminate an individual telecommuting agreement is at the discretion of the agency, and it can be done with thirty days' notice where feasible and consistent with agency operating needs. Employees who have been removed from the Telecommuting Program may reapply for participation no sooner than six months from the date of removal.","score":3,"reasoning":"The reference answer states that an ITS employee must have satisfactory performance to telecommute, which includes factors like a satisfactory performance evaluation, work product, time and attendance record, and a lack of recent disciplinary history or counseling. The model answer correctly states that unsatisfactory performance does not automatically disqualify an employee from telecommuting, but it does not explicitly mention the need for satisfactory performance as outlined in the reference. Instead, it focuses on the process of documenting unsatisfactory performance and the discretion of the agency in deciding telecommuting eligibility. While the model answer provides additional details about the process and potential consequences of unsatisfactory performance, it does not directly address the requirement for satisfactory performance as a condition for telecommuting. Therefore, the model answer is somewhat correct but lacks alignment with the key facts in the reference answer."}
