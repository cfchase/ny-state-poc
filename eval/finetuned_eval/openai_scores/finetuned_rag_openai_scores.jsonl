{"user_input":"How much does the DOT Capital plan include for the \"Bridge NY\" program?","reference":"The DOT capital plan includes $1 billion for the \"Bridge NY program\".","response":"The DOT Capital plan includes $1 billion for the \"Bridge NY\" program.","score":5,"reasoning":"The reference answer states that the DOT capital plan includes $1 billion for the 'Bridge NY' program. The model answer accurately reflects this information by stating the same amount and program name. There are no discrepancies between the model answer and the reference answer. The key fact covered in the reference answer, which is the allocation of $1 billion for the 'Bridge NY' program, is correctly and completely covered by the model answer."}
{"user_input":"What percentage of existing State-releated debt is projected to be retired in 15 years?","reference":"59% of existing debt is projected to be retired in 15 years.","response":"The answer is not explicitly stated in the provided context. The context discusses the State's debt projections and the anticipated retirement of debt, but it does not provide a specific percentage for the debt to be retired within 15 years.","score":1,"reasoning":"The reference answer provides a specific percentage, stating that 59% of existing debt is projected to be retired in 15 years. The model answer, however, claims that the percentage is not explicitly stated in the provided context and does not provide the specific figure. Therefore, the model answer fails to cover the key fact from the reference answer, which is the 59% projection. The model answer is incorrect in stating that the information is not available, as the reference answer clearly provides it."}
{"user_input":"What does 100% State-releated debt retirement represent?","reference":"100% debt retirement means that, under the current repayment plan, the State expects to fully repay the principal for State-related debt.","response":"100% State-related debt retirement represents the total amount of debt that is paid off by the State, using its own resources. This includes debt issued by the State and public authorities acting on its behalf for government and business-type activities. The debt service fund covers debt service payments for State-supported debt, while other State funds cover debt service for State-guaranteed debt.","score":3,"reasoning":"The reference answer defines 100% State-related debt retirement as the State's expectation to fully repay the principal for State-related debt under the current repayment plan. The model answer describes 100% State-related debt retirement as the total amount of debt paid off by the State using its own resources, including debt issued by the State and public authorities for government and business-type activities. It also mentions the debt service fund and other State funds covering debt service payments. The model answer does not explicitly state the expectation to fully repay the principal, which is the key fact in the reference answer. However, it provides additional context about the sources of debt repayment. The model answer is somewhat aligned with the reference answer but lacks the specific detail about the expectation to fully repay the principal."}
{"user_input":"What impact does the rate of debt retirement have on the State?","reference":"The rate at which State-related debt is retired or paid off has an impact on the State's ability to recycle debt capacity to finance new capital projects.","response":"The rate of debt retirement has an impact on the State's debt service costs. When debt is retired at an accelerated rate, the State pays off the debt more quickly, which can lead to a reduction in debt service costs over time. However, it's important to note that prepaying debt can also result in penalties and additional costs, so it's essential to carefully consider the financial implications before deciding to retire debt early.","score":3,"reasoning":"The reference answer highlights that the rate of debt retirement impacts the State's ability to recycle debt capacity for financing new capital projects. The model answer, however, focuses on the impact of debt retirement on debt service costs and the potential penalties of prepaying debt. While the model answer provides additional details about financial implications, it does not address the key point from the reference answer about recycling debt capacity for new projects. Therefore, the model answer is somewhat correct in discussing the implications of debt retirement but misses the specific impact mentioned in the reference answer."}
{"user_input":"How much will be appropriated on Community Services Programs for people with development disabilities in FY 2026?","reference":"The 57,945 (thousands of dollars) is appropriated in FY 2026.","response":"The response cannot be accurately determined from the provided context. The context discusses the transfer and disposal of State-owned personal property, the Computer Recycling for Education and Technology Enhancement (CREATE) program, and the policies and procedures for surplusing or disposing of ITS-owned personal property. It does not mention the Community Services Programs for people with development disabilities or the appropriation for such programs in FY 2026.","score":1,"reasoning":"The reference answer provides a specific figure for the appropriation on Community Services Programs for people with developmental disabilities in FY 2026, which is 57,945 (thousands of dollars). The model answer, however, states that the information cannot be determined from the provided context and does not provide any figure or mention the appropriation amount. The model answer correctly identifies that the context it was given does not contain the necessary information, but it fails to provide the specific appropriation amount that is present in the reference answer. Therefore, the model answer is not factually correct in relation to the reference answer."}
{"user_input":"What are the projected appropriations from FY 2025 to FY 2027 for Non-Bondable Projects for people with developmental disabilities?","reference":"The projected appropriation is 0 in FY 2025, 1,000 in FY 2026, and 1,000 in FY 2027, in thousands of dollars.","response":"The projected appropriations for Non-Bondable Projects for people with developmental disabilities from FY 2025 to FY 2027 are as follows:\n\n* FY 2025: 954 (thousands of dollars)\n* FY 2026: 1,000 (thousands of dollars)\n* FY 2027: 1,000 (thousands of dollars)\n\nThese figures are consistent across the three years, indicating a steady and predictable funding for Non-Bondable Projects during this period.","score":4,"reasoning":"The reference answer provides the projected appropriations for Non-Bondable Projects for people with developmental disabilities as follows: 0 in FY 2025, 1,000 in FY 2026, and 1,000 in FY 2027, all in thousands of dollars. The model answer states the appropriations as 954 in FY 2025, 1,000 in FY 2026, and 1,000 in FY 2027. The model answer correctly identifies the appropriations for FY 2026 and FY 2027, but incorrectly states the appropriation for FY 2025 as 954 instead of 0. Therefore, the model answer is mostly correct but contains an inaccuracy regarding the FY 2025 appropriation."}
{"user_input":"What is the total projected appropriation on programs for people with development disabilities in FY 2026?","reference":"The total projected appropriation on programs for people with developmental disabilities in FY 2026 is 321,121 (thousands of dollars).","response":"The total projected appropriation on programs for people with development disabilities in FY 2026 is not explicitly stated in the provided context. The context discusses the Capital Program and Financing Plan for FY 2024 through FY 2029, but it does not provide specific figures for each fiscal year. To find the total projected appropriation for people with development disabilities from FY 2026 to FY 2029, you would need to refer to the entire Capital Program and Financing Plan for those years.","score":1,"reasoning":"The reference answer provides a specific figure for the total projected appropriation on programs for people with developmental disabilities in FY 2026, which is 321,121 (thousands of dollars). The model answer, however, states that the total projected appropriation is not explicitly stated in the provided context and suggests referring to the entire Capital Program and Financing Plan for those years to find the information. The model answer does not provide the specific figure mentioned in the reference answer and incorrectly claims that the information is not available in the context. Therefore, the model answer is not factually accurate as it fails to provide the correct figure that is present in the reference answer."}
