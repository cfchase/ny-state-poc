{"user_input":"What is a benefit ITS sees in Open-source software (OSS)?","reference":"OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs.","response":"ITS sees several benefits in Open-source software (OSS). First, OSS provides an opportunity to reduce development and operational costs. This is because the source code of OSS is freely available, which means that ITS does not have to pay for the software. Additionally, OSS allows ITS to leverage the work of a community of developers who are constantly improving and updating the software. This can lead to faster development times and more robust software.\n\nAnother benefit of OSS is that it can help ITS maintain an agency culture that supports employee flexibility and mobility. This is because OSS is often developed and maintained by a community of volunteers, which means that ITS can tap into a global pool of talent. This can help ITS attract and retain high-quality employees who are looking for a flexible and mobile work environment.\n\nFinally, OSS can help ITS promote resiliency during work site disruptions, including modified and suspended operations. This is because OSS is often available under an open license, which means that ITS can use the software even if the vendor goes out of business or stops supporting the software. This can help ITS ensure that its critical systems continue to operate even in the face of unexpected disruptions.","score":8}
