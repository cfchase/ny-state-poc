What impact does the rate of debt retirement have on the State?,The rate at which State-related debt is retired or paid off has an impact on the State's ability to recycle debt capacity to finance new capital projects.,,,,"The rate of debt retirement has a significant impact on the State's ability to finance new capital projects. Faster amortization of debt frees up debt capacity, but it also increases debt service costs in the State operating budget. Over time, the practice of retiring debt more quickly increases the State's debt service burden at the expense of other purposes.

In the case of New York State, the expected decrease in debt retirements in FY 2025, largely due to prior prepayments, results in the early retirement of $3.0 billion of bonds that had been scheduled to retire in FY 2025. This decrease in retirements is projected to result in a higher debt service burden for the State.

However, additional retirements beyond the level projected in FY 2025 are possible through debt management actions. The State's debt burden is also affected by the amount of bond-financed capital spending included in the Capital Plan, market interest rates at the time bonds are sold, and the State's longstanding debt practices.

Over a longer time horizon, the State-related debt outstanding as a percentage of personal income is projected to drop from 5.0 percent in FY 2015 to 4.8 percent in FY 2029. This decline can be largely attributed to the retirement of State debt, which has accelerated over the past three years due to early retirement (defeasance) of debt due to prepayments.",4,"The reference answer highlights the impact of the rate of debt retirement on the State's ability to recycle debt capacity for financing new capital projects. The model answer covers this key fact by stating that faster amortization of debt frees up debt capacity, which aligns with the reference answer. Additionally, the model answer provides more detailed information about the consequences of debt retirement, such as increased debt service costs and the impact on the State's operating budget. It also discusses specific examples related to New York State, the potential for additional retirements, and the projected decline in State-related debt as a percentage of personal income. These details, while not present in the reference answer, do not contradict it and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Therefore, the model answer is mostly correct, accurate, and factual in relation to the reference answer."
How much will be appropriated on Community Services Programs for people with development disabilities in FY 2026?,"The 57,945 (thousands of dollars) is appropriated in FY 2026.",,,,"The context provided does not include specific figures for the appropriations on Community Services Programs for people with developmental disabilities in FY 2026. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your question based on the given information.",1,"The reference answer provides a specific figure for the appropriations on Community Services Programs for people with developmental disabilities in FY 2026, which is 57,945 (thousands of dollars). The model answer, however, states that the context does not include specific figures and therefore does not provide an answer. The model answer fails to provide the specific figure mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, the model answer does not cover the key fact provided in the reference answer."
What are the projected appropriations from FY 2025 to FY 2027 for Non-Bondable Projects for people with developmental disabilities?,"The projected appropriation is 0 in FY 2025, 1,000 in FY 2026, and 1,000 in FY 2027, in thousands of dollars.",,,,The context provided does not include specific figures for the projected appropriations from FY 2025 to FY 2027 for Non-Bondable Projects for people with developmental disabilities. Please provide the relevant information or check the source for the required data.,1,"The reference answer provides specific figures for the projected appropriations for Non-Bondable Projects for people with developmental disabilities: 0 in FY 2025, 1,000 in FY 2026, and 1,000 in FY 2027, in thousands of dollars. The model answer, however, states that the context does not include specific figures and suggests checking the source for the required data. The model answer does not cover any of the key facts provided in the reference answer. Therefore, the model answer is not correct, accurate, or factual in relation to the reference answer."
What is the total projected appropriation on programs for people with development disabilities in FY 2026?,"The total projected appropriation on programs for people with developmental disabilities in FY 2026 is 321,121 (thousands of dollars).",,,,"The total projected appropriation on programs for people with development disabilities in FY 2026 is $1,250,000.",1,"The reference answer provides the total projected appropriation for programs for people with developmental disabilities in FY 2026 as 321,121 (thousands of dollars), which translates to $321,121,000. The model answer states the total projected appropriation as $1,250,000. The key fact from the reference answer is the amount of the appropriation, which is $321,121,000. The model answer provides a different amount, $1,250,000, which does not match the reference answer. Therefore, the model answer is factually incorrect as it does not align with the reference answer."
