{"question":"What impact does the rate of debt retirement have on the State?","ground_truth":"The rate at which State-related debt is retired or paid off has an impact on the State's ability to recycle debt capacity to finance new capital projects.","answer":"","rag_answer":"The rate of debt retirement has a significant impact on the State's ability to finance new capital projects. Faster amortization of debt frees up debt capacity, but it also increases debt service costs in the State operating budget. Over time, the practice of retiring debt more quickly increases the State's debt service burden at the expense of other purposes.\n\nIn the case of New York State, the expected decrease in debt retirements in FY 2025, largely due to prior prepayments, results in the early retirement of $3.0 billion of bonds that had been scheduled to retire in FY 2025. This decrease in retirements is projected to result in a higher debt service burden for the State.\n\nHowever, additional retirements beyond the level projected in FY 2025 are possible through debt management actions. The State's debt burden is also affected by the amount of bond-financed capital spending included in the Capital Plan, market interest rates at the time bonds are sold, and the State's longstanding debt practices.\n\nOver a longer time horizon, the State-related debt outstanding as a percentage of personal income is projected to drop from 5.0 percent in FY 2015 to 4.8 percent in FY 2029. This decline can be largely attributed to the retirement of State debt, which has accelerated over the past three years due to early retirement (defeasance) of debt due to prepayments."}
